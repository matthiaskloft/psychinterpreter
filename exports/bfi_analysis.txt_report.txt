### Detailed Factor Interpretations

#### Factor 1 (ML2):: Negative Affect

**Number of significant loadings:** 5  n**Variance explained:** 9.65%  n**Factor Correlations:** ML1 = .25, ML3 = -0.18, ML5 = -0.10,    nnML4 = .02, ML6 = .18

nn**Variables:**nn  1. N1, Get angry easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .852)
  2. N2, Get irritated easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .817)
  3. N3, Have frequent mood swings. (Positive, Strong, .665)
  4. N5, Panic easily. (Positive, Moderate, .439)
  5. N4, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .413)

**LLM Interpretation:**  
ML2 captures the core of negative affect, as evidenced by strong loadings on anger, irritability, mood swings, sadness, and panic. The factor aligns with the neuroticism dimension, where individuals exhibit heightened emotional volatility and sensitivity to stress. Convergent validity is clear: all five neurotic items load above .39, reinforcing a single underlying construct. Discriminant validity is supported by low correlations with the other factors, indicating that this affective instability is distinct from extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness, and the mixed social factor. Clinically, ML2 reflects a tendency toward emotional distress and instability.

#### Factor 2 (ML5):: Agreeable Warmth

**Number of significant loadings:** 7  n**Variance explained:** 7.69%  n**Factor Correlations:** ML2 = -0.10, ML1 = -0.31, ML3 = .19,    nnML4 = .25, ML6 = .14

nn**Variables:**nn  1. A3, Know how to comfort others. (Positive, Strong, .668)
  2. A2, Inquire about others' well-being. (Positive, Strong, .603)
  3. A5, Make people feel at ease. (Positive, Strong, .577)
  4. A4, Love children. (Positive, Moderate, .456)
  5. E4, Make friends easily. (Positive, Weak, .362)
  6. A1, Am indifferent to the feelings of others. (Negative, Weak, -0.360)
  7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Weak, .303)

**LLM Interpretation:**  
ML5 captures agreeableness, as shown by high loadings on caring, comforting, loving children, and making others feel at ease, and a negative loading on indifference. The four agreeableness items all exceed .39, confirming convergent validity. Low correlations with the other factors demonstrate discriminant validity, indicating that this warmth and cooperation dimension is distinct from neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness, openness, and social engagement. ML5 reflects a prosocial, empathetic, and supportive orientation, emphasizing concern for others’ well‑being and a desire to maintain harmonious relationships.

#### Factor 3 (ML1):: Extraversion

**Number of significant loadings:** 7  n**Variance explained:** 7.36%  n**Factor Correlations:** ML2 = .25, ML3 = -0.22, ML5 = -0.31,    nnML4 = -0.19, ML6 = -0.06

nn**Variables:**nn  1. E2, Find it difficult to approach others. (Positive, Strong, .667)
  2. E1, Don't talk a lot. (Positive, Strong, .565)
  3. E4, Make friends easily. (Negative, Strong, -0.527)
  4. N4, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .420)
  5. E5, Take charge. (Negative, Weak, -0.394)
  6. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Weak, .357)
  7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (Negative, Weak, -0.341)

**LLM Interpretation:**  
ML1 represents extraversion, with positive loadings on reticence, social avoidance, and negative loadings on sociability, leadership, and charisma. The factor aggregates five extraversion items that load above .55, confirming convergent validity. Its low correlations with the other factors demonstrate discriminant validity, distinguishing it from neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness, and the social engagement factor. ML1 captures a preference for solitude, reduced verbal expressiveness, and a tendency to withdraw from social interactions, which are hallmark traits of the introverted personality dimension in social contexts.

#### Factor 4 (ML3):: Conscientiousness

**Number of significant loadings:** 5  n**Variance explained:** 7.71%  n**Factor Correlations:** ML2 = -0.18, ML1 = -0.22, ML5 = .19,    nnML4 = .19, ML6 = -0.03

nn**Variables:**nn  1. C4, Do things in a half-way manner. (Negative, Strong, -0.643)
  2. C2, Continue until everything is perfect. (Positive, Strong, .638)
  3. C5, Waste my time. (Negative, Strong, -0.570)
  4. C3, Do things according to a plan. (Positive, Strong, .564)
  5. C1, Am exacting in my work. (Positive, Strong, .532)

**LLM Interpretation:**  
ML3 embodies conscientiousness, with strong positive loadings on exacting work, perfectionism, and planning, and negative loadings on half‑way effort and time waste. The five conscientiousness items all exceed .54, providing robust convergent validity. The factor’s modest correlations with other dimensions confirm discriminant validity, separating it from neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, openness, and social engagement. ML3 reflects a disciplined, organized, and goal‑oriented temperament, characterized by meticulousness, persistence, and a preference for structured, purposeful action in workplace and personal settings and continuous improvement.

#### Factor 5 (ML4):: Openness to Experience

**Number of significant loadings:** 6  n**Variance explained:** 6.25%  n**Factor Correlations:** ML2 = .02, ML1 = -0.19, ML3 = .19,    nnML5 = .25, ML6 = .02

nn**Variables:**nn  1. O3, Carry the conversation to a higher level. (Positive, Strong, .633)
  2. O1, Am full of ideas. (Positive, Strong, .534)
  3. O5, Will not probe deeply into a subject. (Negative, Strong, -0.522)
  4. O2, Avoid difficult reading material. (Negative, Moderate, -0.441)
  5. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Weak, .379)
  6. E3, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Weak, .315)

**LLM Interpretation:**  
ML4 represents openness to experience, with high loadings on idea generation, higher‑level conversation, and reflection, and negative loadings on avoiding difficult reading and not probing deeply. The five openness items all exceed .45, providing clear convergent validity. Its weak correlations with the other factors confirm discriminant validity, distinguishing it from neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and social engagement. ML4 captures intellectual curiosity, imaginative thinking, and a preference for novel, abstract ideas, reflecting a flexible, open‑minded personality style in creative and analytical tasks.
