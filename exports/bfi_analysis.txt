DETAILED FACTOR INTERPRETATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Factor 1 (ML2) - Emotional Volatility
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 9.22%
Factor Correlations: ML1 = .25, ML3 = -.18, ML5 = -.10, ML4 = .02, ML6 = .18

Variables:
  1. N2, Get irritated easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .851)
  2. N1, Get angry easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .851)
  3. N3, Have frequent mood swings. (Positive, Strong, .639)
  4. N5, Panic easily. (Positive, Moderate, .402)
  5. N4, Often feel blue. (Positive, Weak, .389)

LLM Interpretation:
Captures neurotic instability with high loadings on anger, irritability, and mood swings. Low loadings elsewhere confirm discriminant validity. Explains 9.2% variance, indicating core affective dysregulation. Moderate correlation with introversion suggests shared vulnerability, yet conceptually distinct from social or cognitive traits.

Factor 2 (ML1) - Social Reserve
Number of significant loadings: 8
Variance explained: 7.9%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = .25, ML3 = -.22, ML5 = -.31, ML4 = -.19, ML6 = -.06

Variables:
  1. E2, Find it difficult to approach others. (Positive, Strong, .686)
  2. E1, Don't talk a lot. (Positive, Strong, .587)
  3. E4, Make friends easily. (Negative, Strong, -.550)
  4. N4, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .436)
  5. E5, Take charge. (Negative, Moderate, -.405)
  6. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Weak, .355)
  7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (Negative, Weak, -.349)
  8. N5, Panic easily. (Positive, Weak, .256)

LLM Interpretation:
Defined by quietness and social hesitancy, with high loadings on difficulty approaching others. Negative loadings on sociability and leadership reinforce withdrawal. Moderate correlation with emotional volatility suggests shared vulnerability, yet conceptually distinct as behavioral inhibition rather than affective instability.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Factor 3 (ML3) - Conscientious Precision
Number of significant loadings: 6
Variance explained: 7.71%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.18, ML1 = -.22, ML5 = .19, ML4 = .19, ML6 = -.03

Variables:
  1. C2, Continue until everything is perfect. (Positive, Strong, .680)
  2. C4, Do things in a half-way manner. (Negative, Strong, -.634)
  3. C3, Do things according to a plan. (Positive, Strong, .551)
  4. C1, Am exacting in my work. (Positive, Strong, .547)
  5. C5, Waste my time. (Negative, Strong, -.541)
  6. E5, Take charge. (Positive, Weak, .264)

LLM Interpretation:
Reflects structured, perfectionistic work habits with high loadings on exacting standards and planning. Negative loadings on half-hearted effort reinforce diligence. Strong discriminant validity from low correlations with emotional or social factors. Represents self-regulated, goal-oriented behavior essential for task mastery.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Factor 4 (ML5) - Empathic Warmth
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 6.79%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.10, ML1 = -.31, ML3 = .19, ML4 = .25, ML6 = .14

Variables:
  1. A2, Inquire about others' well-being. (Positive, Strong, .688)
  2. A3, Know how to comfort others. (Positive, Strong, .617)
  3. A1, Am indifferent to the feelings of others. (Negative, Strong, -.560)
  4. A5, Make people feel at ease. (Positive, Moderate, .451)
  5. A4, Love children. (Positive, Weak, .391)

LLM Interpretation:
Measures prosocial sensitivity with high loadings on inquiring about well-being and comforting others. Strong negative loading on indifference confirms compassionate orientation. Low correlation with neuroticism suggests emotional stability supports but isn't required for empathy, ensuring discriminant validity.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Factor 5 (ML4) - Intellectual Curiosity
Number of significant loadings: 6
Variance explained: 6.27%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = .02, ML1 = -.19, ML3 = .19, ML5 = .25, ML6 = .02

Variables:
  1. O3, Carry the conversation to a higher level. (Positive, Strong, .656)
  2. O1, Am full of ideas. (Positive, Strong, .564)
  3. O5, Will not probe deeply into a subject. (Negative, Moderate, -.451)
  4. E3, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Weak, .392)
  5. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Weak, .376)
  6. O2, Avoid difficult reading material. (Negative, Weak, -.367)

LLM Interpretation:
Captures cognitive engagement with high loadings on idea generation and elevating conversations. Negative loadings on avoiding complex material reinforce depth-seeking. Moderate correlation with empathy suggests complementary traits in reflective, socially aware thinkers, yet conceptually distinct from emotional or behavioral domains.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Factor 6 (ML6) - Casual Engagement
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 3.12%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = .18, ML1 = -.06, ML3 = -.03, ML5 = .14, ML4 = .02

Variables:
  1. O5, Will not probe deeply into a subject. (Positive, Moderate, .403)
  2. O2, Avoid difficult reading material. (Positive, Weak, .353)
  3. C4, Do things in a half-way manner. (Positive, Weak, .300)
  4. E4, Make friends easily. (Positive, Weak, .287)
  5. A1, Am indifferent to the feelings of others. (Positive, Weak, .281)

LLM Interpretation:
Represents low-effort participation with moderate loadings on superficial interaction and cognitive avoidance. Weak loadings across domains suggest diffuse, peripheral involvement. Minimal correlations with other factors indicate it captures a non-committal, disengaged behavioral style rather than a core personality dimension.
