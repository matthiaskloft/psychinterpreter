DETAILED FACTOR INTERPRETATIONS:
=================================

Factor 1 (ML2) - Negative Affectivity
ML2
Variance explained: 9.2%
Factor Correlations: ML1 = .25, ML3 = -.18, ML5 = -.10, ML4 = .02, ML6 = .18

LLM Interpretation:
This factor captures the tendency toward emotional instability and distress. Strong loadings on anger, irritability, mood swings, sadness, and panic indicate a core negative affectivity construct. It is distinct from extraversion and conscientiousness, showing modest positive links to surface interaction but negative ties to agreeableness.

------------------------

Factor 2 (ML1) - Extraversion
ML1
Variance explained: 7.9%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = .25, ML3 = -.22, ML5 = -.31, ML4 = -.19, ML6 = -.06

LLM Interpretation:
Extraversion is defined by sociability and assertiveness. High loadings on low talk, social approach difficulty, and social influence reflect a tendency toward outward energy. The factor inversely loads on friendliness and leadership, indicating a distinct, socially driven construct that weakly correlates with other personality dimensions.

------------------------

Factor 3 (ML3) - Conscientiousness
ML3
Variance explained: 7.7%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.18, ML1 = -.22, ML5 = .19, ML4 = .19, ML6 = -.03

LLM Interpretation:
Conscientiousness reflects orderliness and goal orientation. Strong loadings on exactness, perfectionism, and planning, coupled with negative loadings on half‑way effort and time waste, delineate a disciplined, self‑regulated construct. It is negatively related to extraversion and agreeableness, but positively to openness.

------------------------

Factor 4 (ML5) - Agreeableness
ML5
Variance explained: 6.8%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.10, ML1 = -.31, ML3 = .19, ML4 = .25, ML6 = .14

LLM Interpretation:
Agreeableness captures warmth and cooperation. High loadings on caring, comforting, and child affection, with a negative loading on indifference, define a prosocial construct. It correlates positively with openness and surface interaction, yet shows weak negative associations with extraversion and conscientiousness.

------------------------

Factor 5 (ML4) - Openness
ML4
Variance explained: 6.3%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = .02, ML1 = -.19, ML3 = .19, ML5 = .25, ML6 = .02

LLM Interpretation:
Openness is characterized by intellectual curiosity and imaginative engagement. Strong loadings on idea generation, higher‑level conversation, and reflection, alongside negative loadings on avoidance of difficult reading and shallow probing, delineate a creative, exploratory construct. It is moderately linked to agreeableness and surface interaction.

------------------------

Factor 6 (ML6) - Surface Interaction
ML6
Variance explained: 3.1%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = .18, ML1 = -.06, ML3 = -.03, ML5 = .14, ML4 = .02

LLM Interpretation:
Surface Interaction captures shallow social engagement. It loads on avoidance of complex reading, limited probing, half‑way task completion, and easy friendship formation. The factor also includes warmth and child affection, suggesting a socially oriented but cognitively light construct that is weakly related to other traits.
