DETAILED FACTOR INTERPRETATIONS:
=================================

Factor 1 (ML2): - Negative Affectivity
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 9.22%
Factor Correlations: ML1 = .25, ML3 = -.18, ML5 = -.10, ML4 = .02, ML6 = .18

Variables:
  1. N2, Get irritated easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .851)
  2. N1, Get angry easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .851)
  3. N3, Have frequent mood swings. (Positive, Strong, .639)
  4. N5, Panic easily. (Positive, Moderate, .402)
  5. N4, Often feel blue. (Positive, Weak, .389)

LLM Interpretation:
The factor captures a core dimension of emotional instability, as evidenced by strong loadings on items reflecting anger, irritation, mood swings, sadness, and panic. These variables converge on the construct of negative affectivity, a hallmark of the neuroticism domain. The factor explains 9.2% of variance and shows modest positive correlations with the Introversion factor ("ML1") and weak negative links to Conscientiousness ("ML3"), suggesting that heightened emotional reactivity tends to co‑occur with social withdrawal but is relatively distinct from orderliness. The pattern supports convergent validity and delineates a distinct affective profile.

------------------------

Factor 2 (ML1): - Social Introversion
Number of significant loadings: 7
Variance explained: 7.9%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = .25, ML3 = -.22, ML5 = -.31, ML4 = -.19, ML6 = -.06

Variables:
  1. E2, Find it difficult to approach others. (Positive, Strong, .686)
  2. E1, Don't talk a lot. (Positive, Strong, .587)
  3. E4, Make friends easily. (Negative, Strong, -.550)
  4. N4, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .436)
  5. E5, Take charge. (Negative, Moderate, -.405)
  6. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Weak, .355)
  7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (Negative, Weak, -.349)

LLM Interpretation:
ML1 represents a social introversion dimension, as indicated by high positive loadings on 'don't talk a lot' and 'find it difficult to approach others', and negative loadings on 'know how to captivate people', 'make friends easily', and 'take charge'. These items converge on reduced outward sociability and assertiveness, aligning with the extraversion facet of the Big Five. The factor accounts for 7.9% of variance and correlates positively with Negative Affectivity ("ML2") while showing modest negative associations with Conscientiousness ("ML3") and Openness ("ML4"). This pattern confirms convergent validity and distinguishes introverted social behavior from other personality domains.

------------------------

Factor 3 (ML3): - Conscientiousness
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 7.71%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.18, ML1 = -.22, ML5 = .19, ML4 = .19, ML6 = -.03

Variables:
  1. C2, Continue until everything is perfect. (Positive, Strong, .680)
  2. C4, Do things in a half-way manner. (Negative, Strong, -.634)
  3. C3, Do things according to a plan. (Positive, Strong, .551)
  4. C1, Am exacting in my work. (Positive, Strong, .547)
  5. C5, Waste my time. (Negative, Strong, -.541)

LLM Interpretation:
ML3 captures the conscientiousness construct, evidenced by strong loadings on items that denote exactness, perfectionism, planning, and a tendency to waste time. The positive loadings on 'exacting', 'perfect', and 'plan', coupled with negative loadings on 'half‑way' and 'waste', delineate a spectrum from disciplined to careless behavior. Accounting for 7.7% of variance, this factor shows weak negative correlations with Introversion ("ML1") and Openness ("ML4"), and a modest positive link to Closed‑mindedness ("ML6"). The pattern confirms convergent validity and distinguishes conscientiousness as a distinct, order‑oriented personality dimension.

------------------------

Factor 4 (ML5): - Agreeableness
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 6.79%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.10, ML1 = -.31, ML3 = .19, ML4 = .25, ML6 = .14

Variables:
  1. A2, Inquire about others' well-being. (Positive, Strong, .688)
  2. A3, Know how to comfort others. (Positive, Strong, .617)
  3. A1, Am indifferent to the feelings of others. (Negative, Strong, -.560)
  4. A5, Make people feel at ease. (Positive, Moderate, .451)
  5. A4, Love children. (Positive, Weak, .391)

LLM Interpretation:
ML5 reflects the agreeableness dimension, with high loadings on items that capture empathy, concern for others, and nurturing behavior. The negative loading on 'indifferent to feelings' and positive loadings on 'inquire', 'comfort', 'love children', and 'make people feel at ease' converge on a cooperative, compassionate construct. Explaining 6.8% of variance, this factor is weakly correlated with Introversion ("ML1") and Openness ("ML4"), and shows a small positive association with Closed‑mindedness ("ML6"). The loadings and correlations support convergent validity and delineate agreeableness as a distinct, prosocial personality trait.

------------------------

Factor 5 (ML4): - Openness
Number of significant loadings: 6
Variance explained: 6.27%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = .02, ML1 = -.19, ML3 = .19, ML5 = .25, ML6 = .02

Variables:
  1. O3, Carry the conversation to a higher level. (Positive, Strong, .656)
  2. O1, Am full of ideas. (Positive, Strong, .564)
  3. O5, Will not probe deeply into a subject. (Negative, Moderate, -.451)
  4. E3, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Weak, .392)
  5. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Weak, .376)
  6. O2, Avoid difficult reading material. (Negative, Weak, -.367)

LLM Interpretation:
ML4 represents the openness to experience construct, as indicated by strong positive loadings on 'full of ideas', 'carry conversation to higher level', and 'spend time reflecting', and negative loadings on 'avoid difficult reading' and 'will not probe deeply'. These items converge on intellectual curiosity and imaginative engagement. Accounting for 6.3% of variance, the factor shows modest positive correlations with Introversion ("ML1") and Conscientiousness ("ML3"), and a small positive link to Closed‑mindedness ("ML6"). The pattern confirms convergent validity and distinguishes openness as a distinct, exploratory personality dimension.

------------------------

Factor 6 (ML6): - Closed‑Mindedness
Number of significant loadings: 2
Variance explained: 3.12%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = .18, ML1 = -.06, ML3 = -.03, ML5 = .14, ML4 = .02

Variables:
  1. O5, Will not probe deeply into a subject. (Positive, Moderate, .403)
  2. O2, Avoid difficult reading material. (Positive, Weak, .353)

LLM Interpretation:
ML6 captures a closed‑mindedness dimension, evidenced by positive loadings on 'avoid difficult reading' and 'will not probe deeply', while other openness items load weakly or negatively. This factor accounts for 3.1% of variance and is weakly positively correlated with Introversion ("ML1") and Openness ("ML4"), and shows a small positive association with Conscientiousness ("ML3"). The loadings and correlations support convergent validity, indicating that individuals who resist intellectual challenge and depth of inquiry tend to exhibit a distinct, less exploratory personality profile, separate from the broader openness construct.
