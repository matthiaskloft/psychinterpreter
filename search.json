N1, Get angry easily. (, , .852)   2. N2, Get irritated easily. (, , .817)   3. N3, Have frequent mood swings. (, , .665)   4. N5, Panic easily. (, , .439)   5. N4, Often feel blue. (, , .413)  LLM Interpretation: Factor ML2 is labeled Emotional Instability. It is defined by strong positive loadings on all five Neuroticism items (N1–N5), all exceeding the 0.3 threshold. The pattern indicates a cohesive construct reflecting frequent negative affect—anger, irritability, mood swings, sadness, and panic. Cross‑loadings are negligible, supporting convergent validity. The factor shows modest positive correlation with ML1 (0.23) and weak negative correlation with ML5 (–0.31), suggesting it is distinct from social reticence and empathic traits. It captures a spectrum of reactive, unstable emotions.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  Factor 2 (ML5) - Empathetic Leadership Number of significant loadings: 7 Variance explained: 7.69% Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.03, ML1 = -.31, ML3 = .20, ML4 = .23  Variables:   1. A3, Know how to comfort others. (, , .668)   2. A2, Inquire about others' well-being. (, , .603)   3. A5, Make people feel at ease. (, , .577)   4. A4, Love children. (, , .456)   5. E4, Make friends easily. (, , .362)   6. A1, Am indifferent to the feelings of others. (, , -.360)   7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (, , .303)  LLM Interpretation: Factor ML5, named Empathetic Leadership, is characterized by sizable loadings on the Agreeableness cluster (A2 0.603, A3 0.668, A4 0.456, A5 0.577) and moderate loadings on Extraversion items (E3 0.303, E4 0.362). The high coefficients on caring and comfort‑oriented variables indicate strong empathic concern, while the social‑skill loadings reflect the ability to attract and influence others. Convergent validity is strong among the A‑items. Cross‑loadings to other factors are minimal, and correlation with ML2 is negative (–0.31), signalling that this empathic construct is distinct from emotional instability regard.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  Factor 3 (ML1) - Introverted Reluctance Number of significant loadings: 7 Variance explained: 7.36% Factor Correlations: ML2 = .23, ML5 = -.31, ML3 = -.22, ML4 = -.17  Variables:   1. E2, Find it difficult to approach others. (, , .667)   2. E1, Don't talk a lot. (, , .565)   3. E4, Make friends easily. (, , -.527)   4. N4, Often feel blue. (, , .420)   5. E5, Take charge. (, , -.394)   6. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (, , .357)   7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (, , -.341)  LLM Interpretation: Factor ML1, named Introverted Reluctance, shows high loadings on E1 0.565 and E2 0.667, capturing a tendency to avoid social contact. Negative loadings on E3 (–0.341), E4 (–0.527) and E5 (–0.394) further indicate reduced social initiative and influence. This pattern aligns with a low‑extraversion construct. The factor has a weak positive correlation with ML2 (0.23) yet negligible connections to ML5 and ML4, underscoring its distinctiveness from empathic and cognitive openness traits. Overall, ML1 quantifies social introversion and reticence and helps in understanding personality profiles for research analysis.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  Factor 4 (ML3) - Conscientious Organization Number of significant loadings: 5 Variance explained: 7.71% Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.21, ML5 = .20, ML1 = -.22, ML4 = .20  Variables:   1. C4, Do things in a half-way manner. (, , -.643)   2. C2, Continue until everything is perfect. (, , .638)   3. C5, Waste my time. (, , -.570)   4. C3, Do things according to a plan. (, , .564)   5. C1, Am exacting in my work. (, , .532)  LLM Interpretation: Factor ML3, termed Conscientious Organization, is defined by strong positive loadings on C1 0.532, C2 0.638, and C3 0.564, and substantial negative loadings on C4 (–0.643) and C5 (–0.570). These coefficients capture a spectrum from orderly, planned behavior to indecisive or half‑hearted action. The factor shows modest negative correlation with ML1 (–0.22), indicating that conscientiousness is slightly inversely related to social reticence, but remains largely distinct from emotional and empathic factors. ML3 thus assesses the degree of dutiful organization versus disorganized execution within the personality structure.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  Factor 5 (ML4) - Cognitive Openness Number of significant loadings: 6 Variance explained: 6.25% Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.01, ML5 = .23, ML1 = -.17, ML3 = .20  Variables:   1. O3, Carry the conversation to a higher level. (, , .633)   2. O1, Am full of ideas. (, , .534)   3. O5, Will not probe deeply into a subject. (, , -.522)   4. O2, Avoid difficult reading material. (, , -.441)   5. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (, , .379)   6. E3, Know how to captivate people. (, , .315)  LLM Interpretation: Factor ML4, titled Cognitive Openness, boasts large positive loadings on O1 0.534, O3 0.633, and O4 0.379, while O2 (–0.441) and O5 (–0.522) load negatively. This pattern differentiates individuals who generate ideas, deepen conversations, and reflect from those who avoid challenging material or probe deeply. Moderate E3 and E5 loadings link subtle social skill aspects. Correlations with ML5 (0.23) and ML2 (–0.01) confirm that cognitive openness is distinct yet moderately related to empathy and emotional stability. ML4 captures intellectual curiosity and openness to experience and perception within personality landscape.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  CROSS-LOADING VARIABLES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  Variables loading on multiple factors (>= 0.3): - E3: ML5 (.303), ML1 (-.341), ML4 (.315) - E4: ML5 (.362), ML1 (-.527) - N4: ML2 (.413), ML1 (.420) - O4: ML1 (.357), ML4 (.379) print(interpretation) FACTOR ANALYSIS INTERPRETATION ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  Number of factors: 5 Loading cutoff: 0.3 LLM used: ollama - gpt-oss:20b-cloud Elapsed time: 27.8  SUGGESTED FACTOR NAMES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  • Factor 1 (9.6%): Emotional Instability • Factor 2 (7.7%): Empathetic Leadership • Factor 3 (7.4%): Introverted Reluctance • Factor 4 (7.7%): Conscientious Organization • Factor 5 (6.3%): Cognitive Openness  Total variance explained: 38.7%  FACTOR CORRELATIONS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  ML2: ML5 = -.03, ML1 = .23, ML3 = -.21, ML4 = -.01 ML5: ML2 = -.03, ML1 = -.31, ML3 = .20, ML4 = .23 ML1: ML2 = .23, ML5 = -.31, ML3 = -.22, ML4 = -.17 ML3: ML2 = -.21, ML5 = .20, ML1 = -.22, ML4 = .20 ML4: ML2 = -.01, ML5 = .23, ML1 = -.17, ML3 = .20  DETAILED FACTOR INTERPRETATIONS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  Factor 1 (ML2) - Emotional Instability Number of significant loadings: 5 Variance explained: 9.65% Factor Correlations: ML5 = -.03, ML1 = .23, ML3 = -.21, ML4 = -.01  Variables:   1.

(, , -.394)   6. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (, , .357)   7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (, , -.341)  LLM Interpretation: Factor ML1, named Introverted Reluctance, shows high loadings on E1 0.565 and E2 0.667, capturing a tendency to avoid social contact. Negative loadings on E3 (–0.341), E4 (–0.527) and E5 (–0.394) further indicate reduced social initiative and influence. This pattern aligns with a low‑extraversion construct. The factor has a weak positive correlation with ML2 (0.23) yet negligible connections to ML5 and ML4, underscoring its distinctiveness from empathic and cognitive openness traits. Overall, ML1 quantifies social introversion and reticence and helps in understanding personality profiles for research analysis.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  Factor 4 (ML3) - Conscientious Organization Number of significant loadings: 5 Variance explained: 7.71% Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.21, ML5 = .20, ML1 = -.22, ML4 = .20  Variables:   1.

C1, Am exacting in my work. (, , .532)  LLM Interpretation: Factor ML3, termed Conscientious Organization, is defined by strong positive loadings on C1 0.532, C2 0.638, and C3 0.564, and substantial negative loadings on C4 (–0.643) and C5 (–0.570). These coefficients capture a spectrum from orderly, planned behavior to indecisive or half‑hearted action. The factor shows modest negative correlation with ML1 (–0.22), indicating that conscientiousness is slightly inversely related to social reticence, but remains largely distinct from emotional and empathic factors. ML3 thus assesses the degree of dutiful organization versus disorganized execution within the personality structure.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  Factor 5 (ML4) - Cognitive Openness Number of significant loadings: 6 Variance explained: 6.25% Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.01, ML5 = .23, ML1 = -.17, ML3 = .20  Variables:   1.

(, , .315)  LLM Interpretation: Factor ML4, titled Cognitive Openness, boasts large positive loadings on O1 0.534, O3 0.633, and O4 0.379, while O2 (–0.441) and O5 (–0.522) load negatively. This pattern differentiates individuals who generate ideas, deepen conversations, and reflect from those who avoid challenging material or probe deeply. Moderate E3 and E5 loadings link subtle social skill aspects. Correlations with ML5 (0.23) and ML2 (–0.01) confirm that cognitive openness is distinct yet moderately related to empathy and emotional stability. ML4 captures intellectual curiosity and openness to experience and perception within personality landscape.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  CROSS-LOADING VARIABLES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  Variables loading on multiple factors (>= 0.3): - E3: ML5 (.303), ML1 (-.341), ML4 (.315) - E4: ML5 (.362), ML1 (-.527) - N4: ML2 (.413), ML1 (.420) - O4: ML1 (.357), ML4 (.379)"},{"path":"https://github.com/matthiaskloft/psychinterpreter/articles/01-Getting_Started.html","id":"view-results","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"View Results","title":"Getting Started with psychinterpreter","text":"Print interpretation report: output shows: - Suggested factor names - variables load factor - brief interpretation factor represents View suggested factor names:","code":"print(interpretation) FACTOR ANALYSIS INTERPRETATION ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  Number of factors: 5 Loading cutoff: 0.3 LLM used: ollama - gpt-oss:20b-cloud Elapsed time: 27.8  SUGGESTED FACTOR NAMES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  • Factor 1 (9.6%): Emotional Instability • Factor 2 (7.7%): Empathetic Leadership • Factor 3 (7.4%): Introverted Reluctance • Factor 4 (7.7%): Conscientious Organization • Factor 5 (6.3%): Cognitive Openness  Total variance explained: 38.7%  FACTOR CORRELATIONS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  ML2: ML5 = -.03, ML1 = .23, ML3 = -.21, ML4 = -.01 ML5: ML2 = -.03, ML1 = -.31, ML3 = .20, ML4 = .23 ML1: ML2 = .23, ML5 = -.31, ML3 = -.22, ML4 = -.17 ML3: ML2 = -.21, ML5 = .20, ML1 = -.22, ML4 = .20 ML4: ML2 = -.01, ML5 = .23, ML1 = -.17, ML3 = .20  DETAILED FACTOR INTERPRETATIONS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  Factor 1 (ML2) - Emotional Instability Number of significant loadings: 5 Variance explained: 9.65% Factor Correlations: ML5 = -.03, ML1 = .23, ML3 = -.21, ML4 = -.01  Variables:   1.

(, , .413)  LLM Interpretation: Factor ML2 is labeled Emotional Instability. It is defined by strong positive loadings on all five Neuroticism items (N1–N5), all exceeding the 0.3 threshold. The pattern indicates a cohesive construct reflecting frequent negative affect—anger, irritability, mood swings, sadness, and panic. Cross‑loadings are negligible, supporting convergent validity. The factor shows modest positive correlation with ML1 (0.23) and weak negative correlation with ML5 (–0.31), suggesting it is distinct from social reticence and empathic traits. It captures a spectrum of reactive, unstable emotions.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  Factor 2 (ML5) - Empathetic Leadership Number of significant loadings: 7 Variance explained: 7.69% Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.03, ML1 = -.31, ML3 = .20, ML4 = .23  Variables:   1.

The high coefficients on caring and comfort‑oriented variables indicate strong empathic concern, while the social‑skill loadings reflect the ability to attract and influence others. Convergent validity is strong among the A‑items. Cross‑loadings to other factors are minimal, and correlation with ML2 is negative (–0.31), signalling that this empathic construct is distinct from emotional instability regard.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  Factor 3 (ML1) - Introverted Reluctance Number of significant loadings: 7 Variance explained: 7.36% Factor Correlations: ML2 = .23, ML5 = -.31, ML3 = -.22, ML4 = -.17  Variables:   1.
