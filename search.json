N1, Get angry easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .852)   2. N2, Get irritated easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .817)   3. N3, Have frequent mood swings. (Positive, Strong, .665)   4. N5, Panic easily. (Positive, Moderate, .439)   5. N4, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .413)  LLM Interpretation: ML2 is dominated by the five neuroticism variables (N1 through N5), with loadings ranging from .393 to .852. These items represent irritability, mood swings, moodiness, affective lability, and panic, all core facets of emotional volatility. The factor thus captures a unified construct of affective instability. Its near-zero correlation with ML5 and ML4, and only modest correlations (.23 with ML1, -.21 with ML3) reinforce its distinctiveness. The absence of significant loadings on extraversion or conscientiousness items ensures discriminant validity, while the strong internal consistency implied by the high loadings indicates excellent convergent validity. ML2 explains 9.6% of the variance and represents the latent trait commonly labeled Neuroticism in personality research.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  Factor 2 (ML5) - Social Compassion Number of significant loadings: 7 Variance explained: 7.69%  Variables:   1. A3, Know how to comfort others. (Positive, Strong, .668)   2. A2, Inquire about others' well-being. (Positive, Strong, .603)   3. A5, Make people feel at ease. (Positive, Strong, .577)   4. A4, Love children. (Positive, Moderate, .456)   5. E4, Make friends easily. (Positive, Weak, .362)   6. A1, Am indifferent to the feelings of others. (Negative, Weak, -.360)   7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Weak, .303)  LLM Interpretation: ML5 is strongly loaded by agreeableness items (A2, A3, A4, A5) and moderately by social‑interaction items (E3, E4). Items such as inquiring about others’ wellbeing, comforting others, and fostering ease in others illustrate the compassionate, pro‑social core of agreeableness. The emotionalthroghness of E3 (captivate people) and E4 (make friends easily) add an interpersonal warmth dimension. The factor’s low correlations with ML2 and ML3 (–.03, .20) and moderate correlation with ML1 (.23) corroborate its construct distinctiveness. High convergent loadings and a coherent theoretical meaning justify naming the factor Social Compassion, explaining 7.7% of data variance.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  Factor 3 (ML1) - Reserved Introversion Number of significant loadings: 7 Variance explained: 7.36%  Variables:   1. E2, Find it difficult to approach others. (Positive, Strong, .667)   2. E1, Don't talk a lot. (Positive, Strong, .565)   3. E4, Make friends easily. (Negative, Strong, -.527)   4. N4, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .420)   5. E5, Take charge. (Negative, Weak, -.394)   6. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Weak, .357)   7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (Negative, Weak, -.341)  LLM Interpretation: ML1 is marked by positive loadings on introvert‑leaning extraversion items (E1 Don’t talk a lot, E2 Find it difficult to approach others) and negative loadings on extroverted cues (E3 captivate people, E4 make friends easily, E5 take charge). This pattern delineates a Reserved Introversion trait—high scores indicate reticence, difficulty in approaching, and a preference for solitude. Moderately high negative load on E3 and E4 ensures the factor diverges from sociability. ML1’s small correlation with ICU (<.30) and weaker loadings on other factors indicate good discriminant validity. The factor accounts for 7.4% of total variance and captures the emotional reserve dimension of personality.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  Factor 4 (ML3) - Task‑Oriented Conscientiousness Number of significant loadings: 5 Variance explained: 7.71%  Variables:   1. C4, Do things in a half-way manner. (Negative, Strong, -.643)   2. C2, Continue until everything is perfect. (Positive, Strong, .638)   3. C5, Waste my time. (Negative, Strong, -.570)   4. C3, Do things according to a plan. (Positive, Strong, .564)   5. C1, Am exacting in my work. (Positive, Strong, .532)  LLM Interpretation: ML3 is comprised almost entirely of conscientiousness items: planning (C3), exacting work (C1), striving for perfection (C2) load positively, while careless (C4), wasted time (C5), and half‑way attitude load negatively. These opposing loadings delineate a clear, internally coherent construct of task orientation versus diligence. The factor shows only weak cross‑loadings (ML2 = –.21, ML5 = .20) and high convergent validity, representing a distinct conscientiousness dimension. This factor accounts for 7.7% of variance and maps onto the traditional Conscientiousness trait, emphasizing personal responsibility, organization, and goal attainment.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  Factor 5 (ML4) - Idea‑Driven Openness Number of significant loadings: 6 Variance explained: 6.25%  Variables:   1. O3, Carry the conversation to a higher level. (Positive, Strong, .633)   2. O1, Am full of ideas. (Positive, Strong, .534)   3. O5, Will not probe deeply into a subject. (Negative, Strong, -.522)   4. O2, Avoid difficult reading material. (Negative, Moderate, -.441)   5. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Weak, .379)   6. E3, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Weak, .315)  LLM Interpretation: ML4 is driven by Openness items: abundant ideas (O1), higher‑level conversation (O3), reflective thought (O4) load positively, whereas avoidance of difficult reading (O2) and deep probing (O5) load negatively, delineating a creative, intellectual openness orientation. The positive loading on E3 (captivate people) and modest positive on E5 (take charge) complement the openness profile. Its correlations with ML5 (.23) and ML3 (.20) are weak to moderate, reinforcing discriminant validity. ML4 explains 6.3% of variation and captures the imaginative, intellectual engagement aspect of personality, aptly named Idea‑Driven Openness.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ print(interpretation) FACTOR ANALYSIS INTERPRETATION ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  Number of factors: 5 Loading cutoff: 0.3 LLM used: ollama - gpt-oss:20b-cloud Tokens:   Input: 1780   Output: 1715 Elapsed time: 9.26  SUGGESTED FACTOR NAMES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  • Factor 1 (9.6%): Emotional Instability • Factor 2 (7.7%): Social Compassion • Factor 3 (7.4%): Reserved Introversion • Factor 4 (7.7%): Task‑Oriented Conscientiousness • Factor 5 (6.3%): Idea‑Driven Openness  Total variance explained: 38.7%  DETAILED FACTOR INTERPRETATIONS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  Factor 1 (ML2) - Emotional Instability Number of significant loadings: 5 Variance explained: 9.65%  Variables:   1.

N1, Get angry easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .852)   2. N2, Get irritated easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .817)   3. N3, Have frequent mood swings. (Positive, Strong, .665)   4. N5, Panic easily. (Positive, Moderate, .439)   5. N4, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .413)  LLM Interpretation: ML2 is dominated by the five neuroticism variables (N1 through N5), with loadings ranging from .393 to .852. These items represent irritability, mood swings, moodiness, affective lability, and panic, all core facets of emotional volatility. The factor thus captures a unified construct of affective instability. Its near-zero correlation with ML5 and ML4, and only modest correlations (.23 with ML1, -.21 with ML3) reinforce its distinctiveness. The absence of significant loadings on extraversion or conscientiousness items ensures discriminant validity, while the strong internal consistency implied by the high loadings indicates excellent convergent validity. ML2 explains 9.6% of the variance and represents the latent trait commonly labeled Neuroticism in personality research.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  Factor 2 (ML5) - Social Compassion Number of significant loadings: 7 Variance explained: 7.69%  Variables:   1. A3, Know how to comfort others. (Positive, Strong, .668)   2. A2, Inquire about others' well-being. (Positive, Strong, .603)   3. A5, Make people feel at ease. (Positive, Strong, .577)   4. A4, Love children. (Positive, Moderate, .456)   5. E4, Make friends easily. (Positive, Weak, .362)   6. A1, Am indifferent to the feelings of others. (Negative, Weak, -.360)   7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Weak, .303)  LLM Interpretation: ML5 is strongly loaded by agreeableness items (A2, A3, A4, A5) and moderately by social‑interaction items (E3, E4). Items such as inquiring about others’ wellbeing, comforting others, and fostering ease in others illustrate the compassionate, pro‑social core of agreeableness. The emotionalthroghness of E3 (captivate people) and E4 (make friends easily) add an interpersonal warmth dimension. The factor’s low correlations with ML2 and ML3 (–.03, .20) and moderate correlation with ML1 (.23) corroborate its construct distinctiveness. High convergent loadings and a coherent theoretical meaning justify naming the factor Social Compassion, explaining 7.7% of data variance.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  Factor 3 (ML1) - Reserved Introversion Number of significant loadings: 7 Variance explained: 7.36%  Variables:   1. E2, Find it difficult to approach others. (Positive, Strong, .667)   2. E1, Don't talk a lot. (Positive, Strong, .565)   3. E4, Make friends easily. (Negative, Strong, -.527)   4. N4, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .420)   5. E5, Take charge. (Negative, Weak, -.394)   6. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Weak, .357)   7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (Negative, Weak, -.341)  LLM Interpretation: ML1 is marked by positive loadings on introvert‑leaning extraversion items (E1 Don’t talk a lot, E2 Find it difficult to approach others) and negative loadings on extroverted cues (E3 captivate people, E4 make friends easily, E5 take charge). This pattern delineates a Reserved Introversion trait—high scores indicate reticence, difficulty in approaching, and a preference for solitude. Moderately high negative load on E3 and E4 ensures the factor diverges from sociability. ML1’s small correlation with ICU (<.30) and weaker loadings on other factors indicate good discriminant validity. The factor accounts for 7.4% of total variance and captures the emotional reserve dimension of personality.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  Factor 4 (ML3) - Task‑Oriented Conscientiousness Number of significant loadings: 5 Variance explained: 7.71%  Variables:   1. C4, Do things in a half-way manner. (Negative, Strong, -.643)   2. C2, Continue until everything is perfect. (Positive, Strong, .638)   3. C5, Waste my time. (Negative, Strong, -.570)   4. C3, Do things according to a plan. (Positive, Strong, .564)   5. C1, Am exacting in my work. (Positive, Strong, .532)  LLM Interpretation: ML3 is comprised almost entirely of conscientiousness items: planning (C3), exacting work (C1), striving for perfection (C2) load positively, while careless (C4), wasted time (C5), and half‑way attitude load negatively. These opposing loadings delineate a clear, internally coherent construct of task orientation versus diligence. The factor shows only weak cross‑loadings (ML2 = –.21, ML5 = .20) and high convergent validity, representing a distinct conscientiousness dimension. This factor accounts for 7.7% of variance and maps onto the traditional Conscientiousness trait, emphasizing personal responsibility, organization, and goal attainment.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  Factor 5 (ML4) - Idea‑Driven Openness Number of significant loadings: 6 Variance explained: 6.25%  Variables:   1. O3, Carry the conversation to a higher level. (Positive, Strong, .633)   2. O1, Am full of ideas. (Positive, Strong, .534)   3. O5, Will not probe deeply into a subject. (Negative, Strong, -.522)   4. O2, Avoid difficult reading material. (Negative, Moderate, -.441)   5. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Weak, .379)   6. E3, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Weak, .315)  LLM Interpretation: ML4 is driven by Openness items: abundant ideas (O1), higher‑level conversation (O3), reflective thought (O4) load positively, whereas avoidance of difficult reading (O2) and deep probing (O5) load negatively, delineating a creative, intellectual openness orientation. The positive loading on E3 (captivate people) and modest positive on E5 (take charge) complement the openness profile. Its correlations with ML5 (.23) and ML3 (.20) are weak to moderate, reinforcing discriminant validity. ML4 explains 6.3% of variation and captures the imaginative, intellectual engagement aspect of personality, aptly named Idea‑Driven Openness.  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ interpretation$suggested_names |>   unlist() |>  data.frame(Suggested_Factor_Name = _) |>   DT::datatable(options = list(scrollX = TRUE), colnames = \"Suggested Factor Name\")"},{"path":"https://github.com/matthiaskloft/psychinterpreter/articles/01-Getting_Started.html","id":"visualize-factor-structure","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Visualize Factor Structure","title":"Getting Started with psychinterpreter","text":"Create visual representation factor loadings:  plot shows variables load strongly factor, making easy see factor structure glance.","code":"plot(interpretation, cutoff = 0.3)"},{"path":"https://github.com/matthiaskloft/psychinterpreter/articles/01-Getting_Started.html","id":"export-results","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Export Results","title":"Getting Started with psychinterpreter","text":"Save interpretation file:","code":"# Export as markdown export_interpretation(   interpretation,   format = \"md\",   file = \"bfi_interpretation\" )  # Export as plain text export_interpretation(   interpretation,   format = \"txt\",   file = \"bfi_interpretation\" )"},{"path":"https://github.com/matthiaskloft/psychinterpreter/articles/01-Getting_Started.html","id":"customizing-your-interpretation","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Customizing Your Interpretation","title":"Getting Started with psychinterpreter","text":"can control several aspects interpretation: Key parameters: cutoff: Threshold displaying results (e.g., minimum loading FA) hide_low_loadings: Whether hide loadings cutoff LLM word_limit: Control verbose LLM interpretations output_format: Choose plain text markdown formatting heading_level: Heading level start report .

**Loading**: Correlation coefficient (-1 to +1) between variable and factor - **Significant loading**: Loading with absolute value >= cutoff threshold - **Convergent validity**: Variables measuring similar constructs should load together; for two factors covering similar constructs, the correlation will be highly positive or negative - **Discriminant validity**: Factors should represent meaningfully distinct constructs; for two factors covering similar constructs, the correlation will be near zero - **Factor correlation**: Correlation between factors indicating relationship strength - **Factor interpretation**: Identifying underlying construct explaining variable relationships - **Variance explained**: Percentage of total data variance captured by each factor - **Emergency rule**: Use highest absolute loadings when none meet cutoff    Main Prompt:   # INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES  ## Factor Naming - **Construct identification**: Identify the underlying construct each factor represents - **Name creation**: Create 2-4 word names capturing the essence of each factor - **Theoretical grounding**: Base names on domain knowledge and additional context  ## Factor Interpretation - **Convergent validity**: Explain why significantly loading variables belong together conceptually - **Loading patterns**: Examine both strong positive/negative loadings and notable weak loadings - **Construct meaning**: Describe what the factor measures and represents - **Factor Relationships**: Use correlation matrix and cross loadings to understand how factors relate to each other - **Discriminant validity**: Ensure factors represent meaningfully distinct constructs; explain how similar factors complement each other  ## Output Requirements - **Word target (Interpretation)**: Aim for 40-50 words per interpretation (80%-100% of limit) - **Writing style**: Be concise, precise, and domain-appropriate  # VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS - A1: Am indifferent to the feelings of others. -

**Loading**: Correlation coefficient (-1 to +1) between variable and factor - **Significant loading**: Loading with absolute value >= cutoff threshold - **Convergent validity**: Variables measuring similar constructs should load together; for two factors covering similar constructs, the correlation will be highly positive or negative - **Discriminant validity**: Factors should represent meaningfully distinct constructs; for two factors covering similar constructs, the correlation will be near zero - **Factor correlation**: Correlation between factors indicating relationship strength - **Factor interpretation**: Identifying underlying construct explaining variable relationships - **Variance explained**: Percentage of total data variance captured by each factor - **Emergency rule**: Use highest absolute loadings when none meet cutoff    Main Prompt:   # INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES  ## Factor Naming - **Construct identification**: Identify the underlying construct each factor represents - **Name creation**: Create 2-4 word names capturing the essence of each factor - **Theoretical grounding**: Base names on domain knowledge and additional context  ## Factor Interpretation - **Convergent validity**: Explain why significantly loading variables belong together conceptually - **Loading patterns**: Examine both strong positive/negative loadings and notable weak loadings - **Construct meaning**: Describe what the factor measures and represents - **Factor Relationships**: Use correlation matrix and cross loadings to understand how factors relate to each other - **Discriminant validity**: Ensure factors represent meaningfully distinct constructs; explain how similar factors complement each other  ## Output Requirements - **Word target (Interpretation)**: Aim for 40-50 words per interpretation (80%-100% of limit) - **Writing style**: Be concise, precise, and domain-appropriate  # VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS - A1: Am indifferent to the feelings of others. -
