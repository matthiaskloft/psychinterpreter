## DETAILED FACTOR INTERPRETATIONS

### Factor 1 (ML2): Emotional Reactivity

**Number of significant loadings:** 5  
**Variance explained:** 9.96%  
**Factor Correlations:** ML5 = -.03, ML1 = .23, ML3 = -.21,    

ML4 = -.01

**Variables:**

  1. N1-Quick_Anger_Response, Get angry easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .852)
  2. N2-Easy_Irritation_Tendency, Get irritated easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .817)
  3. N3-Frequent_Mood_Swings, Have frequent mood swings. (Positive, Strong, .665)
  4. N5-Panic_Easily_Prone, Panic easily. (Positive, Moderate, .439)
  5. N4-Often_Feel_Depressed, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .413)

**LLM Interpretation:**  
This factor captures proneness to negative emotional experiences and instability. Strong loadings on N1 (Quick Anger Response, .852), N2 (Easy Irritation Tendency, .817), and N3 (Frequent Mood Swings, .665) define a construct reflecting neuroticism and emotional dysregulation. Secondary loadings on N4 and N5 further support emotional vulnerability. The factor demonstrates discriminant validity from others, showing near-zero correlations with ML2 and ML4, weak negative correlation with ML5 (-.03), indicating this construct measures distinct emotional temperament independent of agreeableness or openness dimensions.

### Factor 2 (ML5): Interpersonal Warmth

**Number of significant loadings:** 7  
**Variance explained:** 8.41%  
**Factor Correlations:** ML2 = -.03, ML1 = -.31, ML3 = .20,    

ML4 = .23

**Variables:**

  1. A3-Comfort_Others_Effectively, Know how to comfort others. (Positive, Strong, .668)
  2. A2-Inquire_About_Wellbeing, Inquire about others' well-being. (Positive, Strong, .603)
  3. A5-Ease_Others, Make people feel at ease. (Positive, Strong, .577)
  4. A4-Love_Young_Children, Love children. (Positive, Moderate, .456)
  5. E4-Make_Friends_Easily, Make friends easily. (Positive, Moderate, .362)
  6. A1-Indifferent_To_Others, Am indifferent to the feelings of others. (Negative, Moderate, -.360)
  7. E3-Captivate_People_Easily, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Moderate, .303)

**LLM Interpretation:**  
This factor represents compassionate engagement and social attunement. Strong loadings on A3 (Comfort Others Effectively, .668), A2 (Inquire About Wellbeing, .603), A5 (Ease Others, .577), and negative loading on A1 (Indifferent to Others, -.360) define genuine concern for others' emotional states. Moderate loadings on E4 (Make Friends Easily, .362) and E3 (Captivate People Easily, .303) reflect social fluency enabling relationship building. Negative correlation with ML1 (-.31) suggests discriminant validity from social withdrawal. This construct emphasizes empathetic interpersonal behavior distinct from mere social extraversion.

### Factor 3 (ML1): Social Withdrawal

**Number of significant loadings:** 7  
**Variance explained:** 8.28%  
**Factor Correlations:** ML2 = .23, ML5 = -.31, ML3 = -.22,    

ML4 = -.17

**Variables:**

  1. E2-Difficulty_Approaching_Others, Find it difficult to approach others. (Positive, Strong, .667)
  2. E1-Quiet_Communication_Style, Don't talk a lot. (Positive, Strong, .565)
  3. E4-Make_Friends_Easily, Make friends easily. (Negative, Strong, -.527)
  4. N4-Often_Feel_Depressed, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .420)
  5. E5-Take_Charge_Naturally, Take charge. (Negative, Moderate, -.394)
  6. O4-Reflect_On_Things, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Moderate, .357)
  7. E3-Captivate_People_Easily, Know how to captivate people. (Negative, Moderate, -.341)

**LLM Interpretation:**  
This factor represents social inhibition and interpersonal avoidance. Dominant loadings on E1 (Quiet Communication Style, .565) and E2 (Difficulty Approaching Others, .667) characterize reduced social engagement. Strong negative loadings on E3 (Captivate People, -.341), E4 (Make Friends Easily, -.527), and E5 (Take Charge, -.394) indicate difficulty in assertive social interactions and leadership. Secondary loading on N4 (Often Feel Depressed, .420) suggests emotional vulnerability accompanying withdrawal. Negative correlation with ML5 (-.31) confirms discriminant validity, demonstrating this construct captures social introversion distinct from warmth or emotional stability.

### Factor 4 (ML3): Conscientiousness

**Number of significant loadings:** 5  
**Variance explained:** 8.19%  
**Factor Correlations:** ML2 = -.21, ML5 = .20, ML1 = -.22,    

ML4 = .20

**Variables:**

  1. C4-Half-Way_Task_Completion, Do things in a half-way manner. (Negative, Strong, -.643)
  2. C2-Pursue_Perfect_Completion, Continue until everything is perfect. (Positive, Strong, .638)
  3. C5-Waste_Time_Frequently, Waste my time. (Negative, Strong, -.570)
  4. C3-Plan-Oriented_Approach, Do things according to a plan. (Positive, Strong, .564)
  5. C1-Exacting_Work_Standards, Am exacting in my work. (Positive, Strong, .532)

**LLM Interpretation:**  
This factor reflects organized, thorough work orientation and task completion standards. Strong positive loadings on C2 (Pursue Perfect Completion, .638), C1 (Exacting Work Standards, .532), and C3 (Plan-Oriented Approach, .564) emphasize methodical execution and quality focus. Strong negative loadings on C4 (Half-Way Task Completion, -.643) and C5 (Waste Time Frequently, -.570) reinforce disciplined follow-through. Moderate positive loading on E5 (Take Charge, .274) suggests assertive task engagement. Weak correlations with other factors indicate this represents distinct goal-directed behavior. The factor captures classical conscientiousness dimensions of orderliness and dependability.

### Factor 5 (ML4): Intellectual Engagement

**Number of significant loadings:** 6  
**Variance explained:** 6.57%  
**Factor Correlations:** ML2 = -.01, ML5 = .23, ML1 = -.17,    

ML3 = .20

**Variables:**

  1. O3-Elevate_Conversation_Depth, Carry the conversation to a higher level. (Positive, Strong, .633)
  2. O1-Full_Of_Ideas, Am full of ideas. (Positive, Strong, .534)
  3. O5-Avoid_Deep_Exploration, Will not probe deeply into a subject. (Negative, Strong, -.522)
  4. O2-Avoid_Difficult_Reading, Avoid difficult reading material. (Negative, Moderate, -.441)
  5. O4-Reflect_On_Things, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Moderate, .379)
  6. E3-Captivate_People_Easily, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Moderate, .315)

**LLM Interpretation:**  
This factor captures cognitive curiosity and intellectual depth. Strong loadings on O3 (Elevate Conversation Depth, .633), O1 (Full of Ideas, .534), and strong negative loading on O5 (Avoid Deep Exploration, -.522) and O2 (Avoid Difficult Reading, -.441) define active intellectual pursuit and openness to complex ideas. Moderate loadings on E3 (Captivate People, .315) and O4 (Reflect on Things, .379) suggest engaging expression of sophisticated thinking. Weak positive correlations with ML5 and ML3 indicate slight associations with warmth and conscientiousness. This factor distinctly measures openness to experience and preference for cognitive stimulation independent of emotional or interpersonal dimensions.
