\title{Find Overlapping Clusters}
\usage{
find_overlapping_clusters(analysis_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{analysis_data}{Standardized GM analysis data}
}
\value{
List of overlapping cluster pairs, or NULL if no overlaps detected.
Each list element contains:
\itemize{
\item cluster1: Character. Name of first cluster
\item cluster2: Character. Name of second cluster
\item distance: Numeric. Mahalanobis distance between clusters
}
}
\description{
Identifies clusters with significant overlap based on separation threshold.
}
\details{
Clusters are considered overlapping if their Mahalanobis distance is below
the threshold of 2.0. This indicates poor cluster separation and potential
issues with the clustering solution.

Mahalanobis distance accounts for both the distance between cluster centers
and the covariance structure of the clusters, providing a more informative
measure than Euclidean distance.
