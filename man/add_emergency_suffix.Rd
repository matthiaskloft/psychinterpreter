\title{Add Emergency Rule Suffix to Factor Name}
\usage{
add_emergency_suffix(name, used_emergency_rule)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Character. Factor name from LLM}

\item{used_emergency_rule}{Logical. Whether emergency rule was applied}
}
\value{
Character. Name with "(n.s.)" suffix if emergency rule was used,
otherwise unchanged. Special values like "NA", "na", "N/A", "n/a" are
not modified even if emergency rule was used.
}
\description{
Adds the "(n.s.)" suffix to factor names when the emergency rule was used
(i.e., factor has no loadings above cutoff, but top N loadings were used
instead of marking it as undefined).
}
\details{
The "(n.s.)" suffix stands for "not significant" and indicates that the
factor was interpreted based on loadings below the specified cutoff threshold.

Special handling for undefined factor names:
\itemize{
\item "NA", "na", "N/A", "n/a" (case-sensitive) are not modified
\item This prevents double-labeling when factors are undefined
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
add_emergency_suffix("Memory", TRUE)   # "Memory (n.s.)"
add_emergency_suffix("Memory", FALSE)  # "Memory"
add_emergency_suffix("NA", TRUE)       # "NA" (no suffix)
add_emergency_suffix("N/A", TRUE)      # "N/A" (no suffix)
}
