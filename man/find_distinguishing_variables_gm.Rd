\title{Find Distinguishing Variables for Clusters}
\usage{
find_distinguishing_variables_gm(analysis_data, top_n = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{analysis_data}{Standardized GM analysis data}

\item{top_n}{Number of top distinguishing variables per cluster (default = 5)}
}
\value{
Named list with one element per cluster. Each element is a data frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item variable: Character. Variable name
\item cluster_mean: Numeric. Mean value in this cluster
\item overall_mean: Numeric. Overall mean across all clusters
\item distinctiveness: Numeric. Combined distinctiveness score
}
Returns NULL if means are not available.
}
\description{
Identifies variables that best distinguish each cluster from others.
}
\details{
Distinctiveness is calculated by combining two measures:
\enumerate{
\item Deviation from overall mean across all clusters
\item Deviation from average of other clusters
}

Variables with high distinctiveness scores are those that have notably
different values in the target cluster compared to the overall population
and other clusters. These are the key variables that define each cluster's
unique profile.

# After running GM interpretation
library(mclust)
gmm_model <- Mclust(scale(data), G = 3)
var_info <- data.frame(variable = names(data), description = names(data))

                           llm_provider = "ollama", llm_model = "gpt-oss:20b-cloud")

# Find distinguishing variables for each cluster
analysis_data <- interpretation$analysis_data
distinguishing <- find_distinguishing_variables_gm(analysis_data, top_n = 5)

# View results for first cluster
print(distinguishing[[1]])

# Find more variables
