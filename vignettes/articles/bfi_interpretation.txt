DETAILED FACTOR INTERPRETATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Factor 1 (ML2) - Emotional Reactivity
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 9.96%
Factor Correlations: ML5 = -.03, ML1 = .23, ML3 = -.21, ML4 = -.01

Variables:
  1. N1-Anger_Proneness, Get angry easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .852)
  2. N2-Irritability_Levels, Get irritated easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .817)
  3. N3-Mood_Swing_Frequency, Have frequent mood swings. (Positive, Strong, .665)
  4. N5-Panic_Response_Tendency, Panic easily. (Positive, Moderate, .439)
  5. N4-Depressive_Mood_Episodes, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .413)

LLM Interpretation:
ML2 captures emotional instability and negative affect. Anger proneness (.852) and irritability (.817) load most strongly, supported by mood swings (.665), panic responses (.439), and depressive episodes (.413). This factor measures proneness to emotional distress and dysregulation across multiple affective states. The construct reflects a general tendency toward emotional volatility independent of social engagement or conscientiousness. Notably, agreeableness variables load negatively or near-zero, indicating emotional reactivity operates orthogonally to interpersonal warmth, distinguishing it as a discrete neuroticism dimension representing trait negative emotionality.

Factor 2 (ML5) - Interpersonal Warmth
Number of significant loadings: 7
Variance explained: 8.41%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.03, ML1 = -.31, ML3 = .20, ML4 = .23

Variables:
  1. A3-Comfort_Others_Effectively, Know how to comfort others. (Positive, Strong, .668)
  2. A2-Inquire_About_Wellbeing, Inquire about others' well-being. (Positive, Strong, .603)
  3. A5-Ease_Social_Tension, Make people feel at ease. (Positive, Strong, .577)
  4. A4-Love_Children, Love children. (Positive, Moderate, .456)
  5. E4-Easy_Friendship_Formation, Make friends easily. (Positive, Moderate, .362)
  6. A1-Indifferent_To_Others, Am indifferent to the feelings of others. (Negative, Moderate, -.360)
  7. E3-Captivate_Social_Audiences, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Moderate, .303)

LLM Interpretation:
ML5 represents genuine concern and social connectedness. Comfort provision (.668), inquiring about others' wellbeing (.603), and easing social tension (.577) define the core, with weaker support from affection toward children (.456) and social engagement (.362). This factor captures authentic empathy and prosocial motivation. The strong negative loading on indifference (-.360) emphasizes the construct's relational orientation. Secondary loadings on social ease variables suggest warmth facilitates friendship formation, though the factor primarily measures emotional attunement rather than assertiveness. Low correlation with emotional reactivity (-.03) establishes discriminant validity, confirming interpersonal warmth as conceptually distinct from emotional stability.

Factor 3 (ML1) - Social Introversion
Number of significant loadings: 7
Variance explained: 8.28%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = .23, ML5 = -.31, ML3 = -.22, ML4 = -.17

Variables:
  1. E2-Difficulty_Approaching_Others, Find it difficult to approach others. (Positive, Strong, .667)
  2. E1-Quiet_Communication_Style, Don't talk a lot. (Positive, Strong, .565)
  3. E4-Easy_Friendship_Formation, Make friends easily. (Negative, Strong, -.527)
  4. N4-Depressive_Mood_Episodes, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .420)
  5. E5-Take_Charge_Naturally, Take charge. (Negative, Moderate, -.394)
  6. O4-Reflective_Thinking_Time, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Moderate, .357)
  7. E3-Captivate_Social_Audiences, Know how to captivate people. (Negative, Moderate, -.341)

LLM Interpretation:
ML1 characterizes social withdrawal and communication hesitation. Difficulty approaching others (.667) and quiet communication style (.565) form the primary structure, with strong negative loadings on social confidence: captivating audiences (-.341), friendship formation (-.527), and take-charge tendency (-.394). This factor represents introversion as communication avoidance rather than shyness-anxiety. Moderate depressive loading (.420) and reflective thinking (.357) suggest introverts may experience mood concerns and introspection. The negative correlation with warmth (-.31) indicates introverts score lower on proactive social engagement, yet the modest association permits independent variation, supporting both constructs as meaningful personality dimensions in this framework.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Factor 4 (ML3) - Conscientiousness
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 8.19%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.21, ML5 = .20, ML1 = -.22, ML4 = .20

Variables:
  1. C4-Half-Hearted_Work_Effort, Do things in a half-way manner. (Negative, Strong, -.643)
  2. C2-Perfectionist_Work_Approach, Continue until everything is perfect. (Positive, Strong, .638)
  3. C5-Time_Wasteful_Habits, Waste my time. (Negative, Strong, -.570)
  4. C3-Plan-Oriented_Behavior, Do things according to a plan. (Positive, Strong, .564)
  5. C1-Exacting_Work_Standards, Am exacting in my work. (Positive, Strong, .532)

LLM Interpretation:
ML3 robustly measures work discipline and organized behavior. Perfectionism (.638), planning orientation (.564), and exacting standards (.532) load positively, while half-hearted effort (-.643) and time wasting (-.570) load negatively, creating a coherent conscientiousness construct. This factor captures commitment to task completion and systematic approaches. The take-charge loading (.274) suggests organizational confidence accompanies conscientious behavior. Clean separation from other personality domains—near-zero loadings on agreeableness, emotional stability, and openness—provides excellent discriminant validity. Factor correlations remain weak (range -.22 to .20), confirming conscientiousness operates independently, validating its status as a fundamental personality dimension measuring dependability and self-discipline.

Factor 5 (ML4) - Intellectual Engagement
Number of significant loadings: 6
Variance explained: 6.57%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.01, ML5 = .23, ML1 = -.17, ML3 = .20

Variables:
  1. O3-Elevate_Conversation_Depth, Carry the conversation to a higher level. (Positive, Strong, .633)
  2. O1-Generate_New_Ideas, Am full of ideas. (Positive, Strong, .534)
  3. O5-Avoid_Deep_Exploration, Will not probe deeply into a subject. (Negative, Strong, -.522)
  4. O2-Avoid_Complex_Reading, Avoid difficult reading material. (Negative, Moderate, -.441)
  5. O4-Reflective_Thinking_Time, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Moderate, .379)
  6. E3-Captivate_Social_Audiences, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Moderate, .315)

LLM Interpretation:
ML4 captures cognitive curiosity and openness to complexity. Elevating conversation depth (.633) and idea generation (.534) load strongly, with reflective thinking (.379) providing support. Crucially, avoiding complex reading (-.441) and refusing deep exploration (-.522) load negatively, reinforcing the construct's intellectualism dimension. This factor measures preference for abstract thinking, analytical discussion, and intellectual challenge. Secondary loadings on social confidence (captivating audiences: .315; take-charge: .223) suggest intellectual confidence accompanies engagement. Weak correlations across other factors (range -.17 to .23) establish discriminant validity. The factor distinctly captures openness to experience, representing preference for cognitive stimulation independent of emotional, social, or motivational characteristics.
