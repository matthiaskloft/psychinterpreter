DETAILED FACTOR INTERPRETATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Factor 1 (ML2) - Negative Affect
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 9.65%
Factor Correlations: ML5 = -.03, ML1 = .23, ML3 = -.21, ML4 = -.01

Variables:
  1. N1, Get angry easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .852)
  2. N2, Get irritated easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .817)
  3. N3, Have frequent mood swings. (Positive, Strong, .665)
  4. N5, Panic easily. (Positive, Moderate, .439)
  5. N4, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .413)

LLM Interpretation:
ML2 is dominated by high positive loadings on N1 (.852), N2 (.817), N3 (.665), N4 (.413) and N5 (.439). These items capture rapid, intense mood disturbances – anger, irritability, mood swings, depressive feelings and panic – all hallmark features of the neuroticism dimension. The factor’s variance pattern reveals a coherent low‑level emotional regulation construct. Correlations with the other factors are modest (ranging from .23 to –.21), supporting discriminant validity. Convergent validity is strong because all high loadings belong to the same affective domain; they are consistently associated with each other and not with personality traits such as extraversion or conscientiousness. Thus, ML2 reliably measures a tendency toward negative emotional arousal and instability.
