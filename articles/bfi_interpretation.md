## DETAILED FACTOR INTERPRETATIONS

### Factor 1 (ML2): Emotional Reactivity

**Number of significant loadings:** 5  
**Variance explained:** 9.96%  
**Factor Correlations:** ML5 = -.03, ML1 = .23, ML3 = -.21,    

ML4 = -.01

**Variables:**

  1. N1-Anger_Easily_Provoked, Get angry easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .852)
  2. N2-Irritability_Easily_Triggered, Get irritated easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .817)
  3. N3-Frequent_Mood_Fluctuations, Have frequent mood swings. (Positive, Strong, .665)
  4. N5-Panic_Easily_Onset, Panic easily. (Positive, Moderate, .439)
  5. N4-Often_Feel_Depressed, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .413)

**LLM Interpretation:**  
This factor captures neuroticism through proneness to negative emotions. Strong loadings on anger (0.852), irritability (0.817), and mood fluctuations (0.665) indicate individuals who experience frequent emotional disturbances. Moderate loadings on panic (0.439) and depression (0.413) extend the construct to anxiety-related states. The factor demonstrates convergent validity as all significant loadings reflect emotional instability. Notably absent are agreeableness and conscientiousness indicators, establishing discriminant validity. This construct represents trait-level emotional dysregulation independent of social competence or work habits, explaining 10% of total variance—the largest single factor.

### Factor 2 (ML5): Interpersonal Warmth

**Number of significant loadings:** 7  
**Variance explained:** 8.41%  
**Factor Correlations:** ML2 = -.03, ML1 = -.31, ML3 = .20,    

ML4 = .23

**Variables:**

  1. A3-Comfort_Others_Effectively, Know how to comfort others. (Positive, Strong, .668)
  2. A2-Inquire_About_Wellbeing, Inquire about others' well-being. (Positive, Strong, .603)
  3. A5-Ease_Interpersonal_Tension, Make people feel at ease. (Positive, Strong, .577)
  4. A4-Love_Children_Strongly, Love children. (Positive, Moderate, .456)
  5. E4-Make_Friends_Readily, Make friends easily. (Positive, Moderate, .362)
  6. A1-Indifferent_To_Others, Am indifferent to the feelings of others. (Negative, Moderate, -.360)
  7. E3-Captivate_People_Easily, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Moderate, .303)

**LLM Interpretation:**  
This factor represents genuine concern and empathic engagement with others. Primary loadings include comfort effectiveness (0.668), inquiring about wellbeing (0.603), and easing interpersonal tension (0.577), establishing convergent validity through shared prosocial orientation. The inverse loading on indifference (-0.360) further strengthens this interpretation. Secondary loadings on making friends readily (0.362) and captivating people (0.303) suggest social competence accompanies warmth. Absence of conscientiousness or neuroticism loadings ensures discriminant validity. This distinct agreeableness dimension captures genuine care and empathic accuracy, complementing rather than overlapping with other personality dimensions.

### Factor 3 (ML1): Social Introversion

**Number of significant loadings:** 7  
**Variance explained:** 8.28%  
**Factor Correlations:** ML2 = .23, ML5 = -.31, ML3 = -.22,    

ML4 = -.17

**Variables:**

  1. E2-Difficulty_Approaching_Others, Find it difficult to approach others. (Positive, Strong, .667)
  2. E1-Quiet_Conversational_Style, Don't talk a lot. (Positive, Strong, .565)
  3. E4-Make_Friends_Readily, Make friends easily. (Negative, Strong, -.527)
  4. N4-Often_Feel_Depressed, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .420)
  5. E5-Take_Charge_Naturally, Take charge. (Negative, Moderate, -.394)
  6. O4-Reflect_On_Things, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Moderate, .357)
  7. E3-Captivate_People_Easily, Know how to captivate people. (Negative, Moderate, -.341)

**LLM Interpretation:**  
This factor reflects tendency toward social withdrawal and difficulty with interpersonal engagement. Strongest loadings appear on difficulty approaching others (0.667) and quiet conversational style (0.565), establishing convergent validity through shared social inhibition. Inverse loadings on making friends readily (-0.527), taking charge naturally (-0.394), and captivating people (-0.341) reinforce social avoidance. Secondary loadings on depression (0.420) and reflectiveness (0.357) suggest introspection accompanies social withdrawal. Clean separation from other factors ensures discriminant validity. This introversion dimension captures behavioral shyness and social anxiety distinct from emotional reactivity or warmth, representing 8.3% of variance.

### Factor 4 (ML3): Conscientious Diligence

**Number of significant loadings:** 5  
**Variance explained:** 8.19%  
**Factor Correlations:** ML2 = -.21, ML5 = .20, ML1 = -.22,    

ML4 = .20

**Variables:**

  1. C4-Halfhearted_Work_Approach, Do things in a half-way manner. (Negative, Strong, -.643)
  2. C2-Pursue_Perfect_Completion, Continue until everything is perfect. (Positive, Strong, .638)
  3. C5-Waste_Time_Frequently, Waste my time. (Negative, Strong, -.570)
  4. C3-Plan-Based_Task_Execution, Do things according to a plan. (Positive, Strong, .564)
  5. C1-Exacting_Work_Standards, Am exacting in my work. (Positive, Strong, .532)

**LLM Interpretation:**  
This factor embodies work-oriented conscientiousness through disciplined task completion. Significant positive loadings on pursuing perfect completion (0.638), plan-based execution (0.564), and exacting standards (0.532) demonstrate convergent validity around goal-directed behavior. Strong inverse loadings on halfhearted approach (-0.643) and time wasting (-0.570) reinforce commitment to quality work. The positive loading on taking charge (0.274) suggests leadership emerges from conscientiousness. Absence of emotional, social, and openness variables ensures discriminant validity. This factor isolates the productive, organized dimension of personality independent of emotional state or social functioning, accounting for 8.2% of variance.

### Factor 5 (ML4): Intellectual Curiosity

**Number of significant loadings:** 6  
**Variance explained:** 6.57%  
**Factor Correlations:** ML2 = -.01, ML5 = .23, ML1 = -.17,    

ML3 = .20

**Variables:**

  1. O3-Elevate_Conversational_Depth, Carry the conversation to a higher level. (Positive, Strong, .633)
  2. O1-Full_Of_Ideas, Am full of ideas. (Positive, Strong, .534)
  3. O5-Avoid_Deep_Exploration, Will not probe deeply into a subject. (Negative, Strong, -.522)
  4. O2-Avoid_Difficult_Material, Avoid difficult reading material. (Negative, Moderate, -.441)
  5. O4-Reflect_On_Things, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Moderate, .379)
  6. E3-Captivate_People_Easily, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Moderate, .315)

**LLM Interpretation:**  
This factor captures openness through engagement with complex ideas and intellectual depth. Primary loadings include elevating conversational depth (0.633), being full of ideas (0.534), and reflectiveness (0.379), establishing convergent validity around cognitive engagement. Strong inverse loadings on avoiding difficult material (-0.441) and avoiding deep exploration (-0.522) strengthen this interpretation by representing intellectual avoidance inversely. Secondary loadings on captivating people (0.315) suggest eloquence accompanies ideation. Minimal loadings on agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism ensure discriminant validity. This openness dimension represents intellectual engagement and reflective thinking, distinct from personality factors related to emotion, sociability, or work discipline.
