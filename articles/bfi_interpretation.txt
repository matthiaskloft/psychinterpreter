DETAILED FACTOR INTERPRETATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Factor 1 (ML2) - Emotional Reactivity
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 9.96%
Factor Correlations: ML5 = -.03, ML1 = .23, ML3 = -.21, ML4 = -.01

Variables:
  1. N1-Anger_Proneness, Get angry easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .852)
  2. N2-Irritability_Easily_Triggered, Get irritated easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .817)
  3. N3-Frequent_Mood_Swings, Have frequent mood swings. (Positive, Strong, .665)
  4. N5-Panic_Easily_Occurs, Panic easily. (Positive, Moderate, .439)
  5. N4-Often_Feels_Sad, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .413)

LLM Interpretation:
ML2 captures emotional instability and negative affectivity. Strong positive loadings on Anger_Proneness (.852), Irritability_Easily_Triggered (.817), and Frequent_Mood_Swings (.665) indicate a propensity for emotional dysregulation. Secondary loadings on Panic_Easily_Occurs (.439) and Often_Feels_Sad (.413) extend this construct to anxiety and depressive symptoms. The factor demonstrates convergent validity through intercorrelated negative emotional states. Weak loadings on agreeableness and conscientiousness items confirm discriminant validity, showing this represents a distinct emotional temperament dimension independent of interpersonal warmth or task orientation.

Factor 2 (ML5) - Empathic Warmth
Number of significant loadings: 7
Variance explained: 8.41%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.03, ML1 = -.31, ML3 = .20, ML4 = .23

Variables:
  1. A3-Comfort_Others_Effectively, Know how to comfort others. (Positive, Strong, .668)
  2. A2-Inquire_About_Wellbeing, Inquire about others' well-being. (Positive, Strong, .603)
  3. A5-Puts_Others_At, Make people feel at ease. (Positive, Strong, .577)
  4. A4-Love_Children, Love children. (Positive, Moderate, .456)
  5. E4-Makes_Friends_Easily, Make friends easily. (Positive, Moderate, .362)
  6. A1-Indifferent_To_Others, Am indifferent to the feelings of others. (Negative, Moderate, -.360)
  7. E3-Captivates_People_Easily, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Moderate, .303)

LLM Interpretation:
ML5 represents interpersonal sensitivity and compassionate concern for others. Strong positive loadings on Comfort_Others_Effectively (.668), Inquire_About_Wellbeing (.603), and Puts_Others_At_Ease (.577) demonstrate genuine caring behaviors. Secondary loadings on Makes_Friends_Easily (.362) and Captivates_People_Easily (.303) indicate social competence. The strong negative loading on Indifferent_To_Others (-.360) provides inverse validation. This factor exhibits high convergent validity through compassion-related variables and discriminant validity from other dimensions. The mild positive correlation with ML3 suggests conscientiousness facilitates empathic expression.

Factor 3 (ML1) - Social Withdrawal
Number of significant loadings: 7
Variance explained: 8.28%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = .23, ML5 = -.31, ML3 = -.22, ML4 = -.17

Variables:
  1. E2-Difficulty_Approaching_Others, Find it difficult to approach others. (Positive, Strong, .667)
  2. E1-Quiet_Speech_Patterns, Don't talk a lot. (Positive, Strong, .565)
  3. E4-Makes_Friends_Easily, Make friends easily. (Negative, Strong, -.527)
  4. N4-Often_Feels_Sad, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .420)
  5. E5-Takes_Charge_Naturally, Take charge. (Negative, Moderate, -.394)
  6. O4-Reflects_On_Things, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Moderate, .357)
  7. E3-Captivates_People_Easily, Know how to captivate people. (Negative, Moderate, -.341)

LLM Interpretation:
ML1 represents introversion and social inhibition. Dominant positive loadings on Quiet_Speech_Patterns (.565) and Difficulty_Approaching_Others (.667) define reserved social engagement. Strong negative loadings on Makes_Friends_Easily (-.527), Captivates_People_Easily (-.341), and Takes_Charge_Naturally (-.394) indicate social assertiveness deficits. Secondary loadings on Often_Feels_Sad (.420) and Reflects_On_Things (.357) suggest introspective tendencies. Convergent validity is demonstrated through consistent social avoidance indicators. Moderate positive correlation with ML2 indicates withdrawn individuals experience elevated emotional reactivity, while negative correlation with ML5 shows social withdrawal opposes empathic engagement.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Factor 4 (ML3) - Conscientious Perfectionism
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 8.19%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.21, ML5 = .20, ML1 = -.22, ML4 = .20

Variables:
  1. C4-Half-Way_Task_Completion, Do things in a half-way manner. (Negative, Strong, -.643)
  2. C2-Pursue_Perfect_Standards, Continue until everything is perfect. (Positive, Strong, .638)
  3. C5-Wastes_Time, Waste my time. (Negative, Strong, -.570)
  4. C3-Plan_Oriented_Work, Do things according to a plan. (Positive, Strong, .564)
  5. C1-Exacting_In_Work, Am exacting in my work. (Positive, Strong, .532)

LLM Interpretation:
ML3 captures organized, standards-driven work behavior. Strong positive loadings on Pursue_Perfect_Standards (.638), Plan_Oriented_Work (.564), and Exacting_In_Work (.532) define meticulous task engagement. Strong negative loadings on Half-Way_Task_Completion (-.643) and Wastes_Time (-.570) confirm commitment to quality completion. Secondary positive loading on Takes_Charge_Naturally (.274) suggests decisive responsibility-taking. This factor demonstrates excellent convergent validity through intercorrelated conscientiousness indicators and discriminant validity from emotional and social factors. The small positive correlation with ML5 suggests conscientious individuals may extend their diligence to relationship maintenance.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Factor 5 (ML4) - Intellectual Engagement
Number of significant loadings: 6
Variance explained: 6.57%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.01, ML5 = .23, ML1 = -.17, ML3 = .20

Variables:
  1. O3-Elevates_Conversation_Level, Carry the conversation to a higher level. (Positive, Strong, .633)
  2. O1-Full_Of_Ideas, Am full of ideas. (Positive, Strong, .534)
  3. O5-Avoids_Deep_Probing, Will not probe deeply into a subject. (Negative, Strong, -.522)
  4. O2-Avoids_Difficult_Material, Avoid difficult reading material. (Negative, Moderate, -.441)
  5. O4-Reflects_On_Things, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Moderate, .379)
  6. E3-Captivates_People_Easily, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Moderate, .315)

LLM Interpretation:
ML4 represents cognitive curiosity and intellectual depth. Strong positive loadings on Elevates_Conversation_Level (.633), Full_Of_Ideas (.534), and Reflects_On_Things (.379) indicate active intellectual pursuit. Strong negative loadings on Avoids_Deep_Probing (-.522) and Avoids_Difficult_Material (-.441) confirm preference for cognitive challenge. Secondary loading on Captivates_People_Easily (.315) suggests intellectuals communicate engagingly. This factor demonstrates convergent validity through openness-to-experience variables and discriminant validity from personality dimensions. Weak positive correlations with ML5 and ML3 suggest intellectually engaged individuals balance depth-seeking with interpersonal warmth and organizational thoroughness.
