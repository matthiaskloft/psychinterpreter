DETAILED FACTOR INTERPRETATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Factor 1 (ML2) - Negative Affectivity
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 9.65%
Factor Correlations: ML5 = -.03, ML1 = .23, ML3 = -.21, ML4 = -.01

Variables:
  1. N1, Get angry easily. (, , .852)
  2. N2, Get irritated easily. (, , .817)
  3. N3, Have frequent mood swings. (, , .665)
  4. N5, Panic easily. (, , .439)
  5. N4, Often feel blue. (, , .413)

LLM Interpretation:
ML2 captures core Neuroticism, with high loadings on anger, irritability, mood swings, sadness, and panic. The construct represents emotional instability and frequent negative affect. These variables converge to form a cohesive “Negative Affectivity” factor, explaining 9.6 % of overall variance. Its modest correlations with other factors (e.g., -.03 with ML5, .23 with ML1) suggest it is distinct yet shares a slight positive link with extraversion‑related traits. The factor shows excellent convergent validity, as all five high‑loading items consistently reflect the same affective domain.

Factor 2 (ML5) - Warmth & Empathy
Number of significant loadings: 7
Variance explained: 7.69%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.03, ML1 = -.31, ML3 = .20, ML4 = .23

Variables:
  1. A3, Know how to comfort others. (, , .668)
  2. A2, Inquire about others' well-being. (, , .603)
  3. A5, Make people feel at ease. (, , .577)
  4. A4, Love children. (, , .456)
  5. E4, Make friends easily. (, , .362)
  6. A1, Am indifferent to the feelings of others. (, , -.360)
  7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (, , .303)

LLM Interpretation:
ML5 embodies Agreeableness and Social Warmth, with strong loadings on interpersonal concern (Ask about well‑being), comfort skills (Know how to comfort), and empathy (Make people feel at ease). Its moderate loadings from extroverted actions (Make friends easily) and thoughtfulness (Avoid difficult reading) reflect a balanced, considerate disposition. The factor accounts for 7.7 % of variance and shows weak negative correlations with ML2 (‑.03) and modest positive liens with ML4 (.23) and ML1 (‑.31), indicating it’s largely distinct from affective and extraverted constructs while offering complementary insights.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Factor 3 (ML1) - Introverted Reflection
Number of significant loadings: 7
Variance explained: 7.36%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = .23, ML5 = -.31, ML3 = -.22, ML4 = -.17

Variables:
  1. E2, Find it difficult to approach others. (, , .667)
  2. E1, Don't talk a lot. (, , .565)
  3. E4, Make friends easily. (, , -.527)
  4. N4, Often feel blue. (, , .420)
  5. E5, Take charge. (, , -.394)
  6. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (, , .357)
  7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (, , -.341)

LLM Interpretation:
ML1 reflects Introverted Reflection, integrating high loadings on reserved extraversion items (Don’t talk a lot, Find it difficult to approach others) and low assertiveness indicators (Know how to captivate, Make friends easily, Take charge). The additional positive loading on Reflective Thinking (Spend time reflecting) and modest positive mood cues (Often feel blue, Panic) suggest a conscientious, self‑contained orientation. Accounting for 7.4 % of variance, this factor presents moderate correlations with extraversion (ML5, .23) but remains largely independent of neuroticism (ML2, .23) and conscientiousness (ML3, −.22).

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Factor 4 (ML3) - Perfectionist Conscientiousness
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 7.71%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.21, ML5 = .20, ML1 = -.22, ML4 = .20

Variables:
  1. C4, Do things in a half-way manner. (, , -.643)
  2. C2, Continue until everything is perfect. (, , .638)
  3. C5, Waste my time. (, , -.570)
  4. C3, Do things according to a plan. (, , .564)
  5. C1, Am exacting in my work. (, , .532)

LLM Interpretation:
ML3 captures Conscientiousness‑Perfect, dominated by high loadings on diligent planning and order (Exacting work, Continue until perfect, Do things according to a plan) and negatively on half‑way and wasted work, underscoring a disciplined, perfectionistic ethos. The modest positive loading on making people feel at ease (A5) hints at a prosocial element. Explaining 7.7 % of the variance, the factor shows small inverse ties to extraversion (ML1, −.22) and modest positive links to Agreeableness and Creativity (ML4, .20, .23), and further enrich the model.

Factor 5 (ML4) - Creative Social Insight
Number of significant loadings: 6
Variance explained: 6.25%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.01, ML5 = .23, ML1 = -.17, ML3 = .20

Variables:
  1. O3, Carry the conversation to a higher level. (, , .633)
  2. O1, Am full of ideas. (, , .534)
  3. O5, Will not probe deeply into a subject. (, , -.522)
  4. O2, Avoid difficult reading material. (, , -.441)
  5. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (, , .379)
  6. E3, Know how to captivate people. (, , .315)

LLM Interpretation:
ML4 illustrates Creative Social Insight, merging high loadings from idea generation (Full of ideas, Carry conversation to a higher level) and social charm (Know how to captivate, Take charge) with a tendency to avoid deep probing and complex reading. This factor embodies a sociable, imaginative orientation emphasizing surface‑level elaboration. It accounts for 6.3 % of total variance and shows weak negative ties to neuroticism (ML2, −.01) but relatively stronger positive relations with Agreeableness (ML5, .23) and Introverted Reflection (ML1, −.17), reflecting its complementary yet distinct nature.
