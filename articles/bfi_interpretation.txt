DETAILED FACTOR INTERPRETATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Factor 1 (ML2) - Negative Affectivity
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 9.65%
Factor Correlations: ML5 = -.03, ML1 = .23, ML3 = -.21, ML4 = -.01

Variables:
  1. N1, Get angry easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .852)
  2. N2, Get irritated easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .817)
  3. N3, Have frequent mood swings. (Positive, Strong, .665)
  4. N5, Panic easily. (Positive, Moderate, .439)
  5. N4, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .413)

LLM Interpretation:
ML2 captures a cohesive negative affectivity construct. The predominance of strong loadings from N1 through N5 indicates that this factor reflects a general tendency toward mood volatility, irritability, and anxiety. The uniformly positive loadings confirm convergent validity: all neurotic symptoms load together, making this factor a clear manifestation of neuroticism. No other variable demonstrates a significant loading, evidencing discriminant validity with the other dimensions. Cross‑factor correlations show a modest positive association with Introverted Reflection (ML1) and a mild negative link with Perfectionist Conscientiousness (ML3), suggesting that those high in neuroticism tend to be more introspective and less meticulously organized. The negligible correlations with Compassionate Warmth (ML5) and Intellectual Curiosity (ML4) imply that emotional instability largely operates independently of interpersonal warmth and cognitive openness.

Factor 2 (ML5) - Compassionate Warmth
Number of significant loadings: 7
Variance explained: 7.69%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.03, ML1 = -.31, ML3 = .20, ML4 = .23

Variables:
  1. A3, Know how to comfort others. (Positive, Strong, .668)
  2. A2, Inquire about others' well-being. (Positive, Strong, .603)
  3. A5, Make people feel at ease. (Positive, Strong, .577)
  4. A4, Love children. (Positive, Moderate, .456)
  5. E4, Make friends easily. (Positive, Weak, .362)
  6. A1, Am indifferent to the feelings of others. (Negative, Weak, -.360)
  7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Weak, .303)

LLM Interpretation:
ML5 represents an empathic‑warmth dimension, anchored by high loadings from A2, A3, A4, and A5. These items map onto the ability to recognize others’ needs, provide comfort, show affection toward children, and create a sense of ease, constructing a clear convergent cluster. Supporting variables E3 (captivate people) and E4 (make friends easily) emphasize social skill and interpersonal approach, reinforcing the warmth aspect. Low or negative loadings from other factors confirm its discriminant validity. Cross‑factor correlations indicate a slight positive link with Intellectual Curiosity (ML4), suggesting that individuals who value cognitive exploration also tend to be socially attuned. A negative correlation with Introverted Reflection (ML1) and a marginal negative relationship to Perfectionist Conscientiousness (ML3) imply that warmth is relatively independent from shyness or meticulous work habits.

Factor 3 (ML1) - Introverted Reflection
Number of significant loadings: 7
Variance explained: 7.36%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = .23, ML5 = -.31, ML3 = -.22, ML4 = -.17

Variables:
  1. E2, Find it difficult to approach others. (Positive, Strong, .667)
  2. E1, Don't talk a lot. (Positive, Strong, .565)
  3. E4, Make friends easily. (Negative, Strong, -.527)
  4. N4, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .420)
  5. E5, Take charge. (Negative, Weak, -.394)
  6. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Weak, .357)
  7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (Negative, Weak, -.341)

LLM Interpretation:
ML1 functions as a latent dimension of introverted self‑contemplation. Two core items, E1 and E2, load strongly, signifying a tendency to speak sparingly and approach others cautiously. The negative loadings of E3, E4, and E5—behaviors associated with talkativeness, engagement, and initiative—reinforce this conception of reticence. O4’s positive loading additionally signals a preference for reflective thought. Consequently, ML1 captures introversion coupled with introspective tendencies. Convergent validity is evident through the clustering of these related behaviors, while weak loadings of all other variables establish discriminant separation from the other factors. Correlations reveal a moderate positive association with Neuroticism (ML2) and moderate negative associations with Compassionate Warmth (ML5) and Perfectionist Conscientiousness (ML3), indicating that introverted reflection often co‑occurs with emotional volatility but diverges from socially warm or highly organized profiles.

Factor 4 (ML3) - Perfectionist Conscientiousity
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 7.71%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.21, ML5 = .20, ML1 = -.22, ML4 = .20

Variables:
  1. C4, Do things in a half-way manner. (Negative, Strong, -.643)
  2. C2, Continue until everything is perfect. (Positive, Strong, .638)
  3. C5, Waste my time. (Negative, Strong, -.570)
  4. C3, Do things according to a plan. (Positive, Strong, .564)
  5. C1, Am exacting in my work. (Positive, Strong, .532)

LLM Interpretation:
ML3 encapsulates a perfectionistic, conscientious work orientation. Strong positive loadings on C1 (exacting), C2 (perfection) and C3 (planful) align these items around a rigorous, organized approach to tasks. The notable negative loadings from C4 (half‑way approach) and C5 (time‑wasting) clarify that this factor is not simply general conscientiousness but a specific anti‑slackness orientation. Convergent validity is established by the coherence of these opposite ends of work style. Weak or non‑existent loadings on extraneous factors illustrate discriminant validity. Cross‑factor correlations show a slight negative link to Introverted Reflection (ML1), moderate negative with Compassionate Warmth (ML5), and weak positive with Neuroticism (ML2), suggesting that highly perfectionistic individuals are slightly more introspective, less warm, and may carry a modest level of emotional reactivity.

Factor 5 (ML4) - Intellectual Curiosity
Number of significant loadings: 6
Variance explained: 6.25%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.01, ML5 = .23, ML1 = -.17, ML3 = .20

Variables:
  1. O3, Carry the conversation to a higher level. (Positive, Strong, .633)
  2. O1, Am full of ideas. (Positive, Strong, .534)
  3. O5, Will not probe deeply into a subject. (Negative, Strong, -.522)
  4. O2, Avoid difficult reading material. (Negative, Moderate, -.441)
  5. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Weak, .379)
  6. E3, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Weak, .315)

LLM Interpretation:
ML4 represents an intellectual curiosity construct, grounded by high loadings on O1 (full of ideas), O3 (carry conversation higher level) and O4 (spend time reflecting). The opposing loadings on O2 (avoid difficult reading) and O5 (will not probe deeply) reinforce this interpretation as a preference for exploring complex ideas versus superficial engagement. E3 (captivate people) and E5 (take charge) provide secondary support for social‑cognitive expression. Convergent validity is robust, with the key Openness items coalescing under a single factor, while the lack of strong loadings from other domains underscores discriminant separation. Factor correlations reveal modest positive associations with Compassionate Warmth (ML5) and Negative Affectivity (ML2), indicating that curious individuals may simultaneously exhibit warmth or emotional sensitivity, yet remain relatively independent from Introverted Reflection (ML1) and Perfectionist Conscientiousness (ML3).
