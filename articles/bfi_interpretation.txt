DETAILED FACTOR INTERPRETATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Factor 1 (ML2) - Negative Emotionality
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 9.96%
Factor Correlations: ML5 = -.03, ML1 = .23, ML3 = -.21, ML4 = -.01

Variables:
  1. N1-Anger_Proneness, Get angry easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .852)
  2. N2-Irritability_Frequency, Get irritated easily. (Positive, Very Strong, .817)
  3. N3-Mood_Swing_Frequency, Have frequent mood swings. (Positive, Strong, .665)
  4. N5-Panic_Prone_Easily, Panic easily. (Positive, Moderate, .439)
  5. N4-Sadness_Frequency, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .413)

LLM Interpretation:
This factor captures emotional instability and vulnerability, dominated by anger proneness (.852), irritability (.817), and mood swings (.665). Secondary loadings include panic tendency (.439) and sadness (.413). The construct represents a general predisposition toward negative emotional states, characterized by reactive frustration and emotional dysregulation. Variables load positively, indicating that individuals scoring high experience frequent negative emotions across multiple dimensions. This factor shows weak correlations with other factors, suggesting emotional reactivity operates independently from interpersonal warmth, introversion, conscientiousness, and openness dimensions.

Factor 2 (ML5) - Interpersonal Warmth
Number of significant loadings: 7
Variance explained: 8.41%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.03, ML1 = -.31, ML3 = .20, ML4 = .23

Variables:
  1. A3-Comfort_Others_Effectively, Know how to comfort others. (Positive, Strong, .668)
  2. A2-Inquire_About_Well-Being, Inquire about others' well-being. (Positive, Strong, .603)
  3. A5-Put_Others_At, Make people feel at ease. (Positive, Strong, .577)
  4. A4-Love_For_Children, Love children. (Positive, Moderate, .456)
  5. E4-Easily_Make_Friends, Make friends easily. (Positive, Moderate, .362)
  6. A1-Indifferent_To_Others, Am indifferent to the feelings of others. (Negative, Moderate, -.360)
  7. E3-Captivate_Others_Effectively, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Moderate, .303)

LLM Interpretation:
This factor represents genuine concern and empathic engagement with others, defined by comfort abilities (.668), inquiry about well-being (.603), and putting others at ease (.577). Supporting loadings include friendliness (.362) and captivation skills (.303). The strong negative loading for indifference (-.360) reinforces the prosocial nature of this construct. Variables measure affective concern and interpersonal competence in meeting others' emotional needs. The moderate positive correlation with ML3 (.20) suggests conscientiousness supports empathic behaviors, while the negative correlation with ML1 (-.31) indicates warmth opposes withdrawal tendencies, demonstrating discriminant validity.

Factor 3 (ML1) - Social Withdrawal
Number of significant loadings: 7
Variance explained: 8.28%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = .23, ML5 = -.31, ML3 = -.22, ML4 = -.17

Variables:
  1. E2-Difficulty_Approaching_Others, Find it difficult to approach others. (Positive, Strong, .667)
  2. E1-Limited_Verbal_Communication, Don't talk a lot. (Positive, Strong, .565)
  3. E4-Easily_Make_Friends, Make friends easily. (Negative, Strong, -.527)
  4. N4-Sadness_Frequency, Often feel blue. (Positive, Moderate, .420)
  5. E5-Take_Charge_Naturally, Take charge. (Negative, Moderate, -.394)
  6. O4-Reflective_Thinking_Time, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Moderate, .357)
  7. E3-Captivate_Others_Effectively, Know how to captivate people. (Negative, Moderate, -.341)

LLM Interpretation:
This factor represents introversion and social avoidance, primarily defined by difficulty approaching others (.667), limited communication (.565), sadness (.420), and panic tendency (.248). Strong negative loadings indicate inverse relationships with leadership (.394), friendship ease (-.527), and people captivation (-.341). The construct measures social inhibition, combining communication restraint with interpersonal anxiety. Reflective thinking (.357) suggests introspection accompanying withdrawal. The negative correlation with ML5 (-.31) demonstrates that withdrawal opposes warmth and engagement. Positive correlation with ML2 (.23) indicates emotional instability accompanies social anxiety, while negative correlations with ML3 and ML4 show withdrawal opposes competence and openness.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Factor 4 (ML3) - Conscientiousness and Discipline
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 8.19%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.21, ML5 = .20, ML1 = -.22, ML4 = .20

Variables:
  1. C4-Half-Way_Task_Completion, Do things in a half-way manner. (Negative, Strong, -.643)
  2. C2-Pursue_Perfect_Completion, Continue until everything is perfect. (Positive, Strong, .638)
  3. C5-Time_Wasteful_Behavior, Waste my time. (Negative, Strong, -.570)
  4. C3-Plan-Oriented_Behavior, Do things according to a plan. (Positive, Strong, .564)
  5. C1-Exacting_Work_Standards, Am exacting in my work. (Positive, Strong, .532)

LLM Interpretation:
This factor reflects organized, goal-directed behavior centered on work standards (.532), perfectionism (.638), and planning (.564). Strong negative loadings for half-way completion (-.643) and time-wasting (-.570) further define disciplined commitment. Leadership (.274) provides secondary support. The construct measures conscientiousness through both positive striving and rejection of shortcuts or procrastination. Positive correlations with ML5 (.20) and ML4 (.20) suggest organized individuals are both warmer and more intellectually open. The negative correlation with ML1 (-.22) shows conscientiousness opposes social withdrawal. This factor demonstrates solid discriminant validity as a distinct behavioral structure dimension.

Factor 5 (ML4) - Intellectual Engagement
Number of significant loadings: 6
Variance explained: 6.57%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.01, ML5 = .23, ML1 = -.17, ML3 = .20

Variables:
  1. O3-Elevate_Conversation_Depth, Carry the conversation to a higher level. (Positive, Strong, .633)
  2. O1-Full_Of_Ideas, Am full of ideas. (Positive, Strong, .534)
  3. O5-Avoid_Deep_Exploration, Will not probe deeply into a subject. (Negative, Strong, -.522)
  4. O2-Avoid_Difficult_Reading, Avoid difficult reading material. (Negative, Moderate, -.441)
  5. O4-Reflective_Thinking_Time, Spend time reflecting on things. (Positive, Moderate, .379)
  6. E3-Captivate_Others_Effectively, Know how to captivate people. (Positive, Moderate, .315)

LLM Interpretation:
This factor captures openness to ideas and intellectual curiosity, dominated by conversational depth (.633) and ideation (.534). Strong negative loadings for avoiding difficult reading (-.522) and exploration aversion (-.522) establish the factor's intellectual engagement quality. Reflective thinking (.379) and people captivation (.315) provide supporting context. The construct measures cognitive openness and engagement with complex ideas rather than passive receptivity. Moderate positive correlations with ML5 (.23) and ML3 (.20) suggest engaged individuals balance intellectual pursuits with warmth and organization. The negative correlation with ML1 (-.17) indicates openness opposes social withdrawal. This factor represents meaningful intellectual and interpersonal sophistication.
