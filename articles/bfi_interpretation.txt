DETAILED FACTOR INTERPRETATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Factor 1 (ML2) - Neurotic Tendencies
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 9.65%
Factor Correlations: ML5 = -.03, ML1 = .23, ML3 = -.21, ML4 = -.01

Variables:
  1. N1, Get angry easily. (, , .852)
  2. N2, Get irritated easily. (, , .817)
  3. N3, Have frequent mood swings. (, , .665)
  4. N5, Panic easily. (, , .439)
  5. N4, Often feel blue. (, , .413)

LLM Interpretation:
ML2 represents neurotic tendencies, with high loadings on N1–N5 (0.41–0.85). These items capture irritability, mood swings, and anxiety, supporting convergent validity. The factor shows a modest positive correlation with Introverted Social Tendencies (ML1, r=.23) and near-zero relationship with Openness (ML4, r≈0). Its negative correlation with Conscientiousness (ML3, r=–.21) suggests that higher neuroticism is linked to lower orderliness. These patterns differentiate ML2 from other factors while underscoring its role in emotional instability. This core emotional volatility factor shapes behavior across situations.

Factor 2 (ML5) - Prosocial Orientation
Number of significant loadings: 7
Variance explained: 7.69%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.03, ML1 = -.31, ML3 = .20, ML4 = .23

Variables:
  1. A3, Know how to comfort others. (, , .668)
  2. A2, Inquire about others' well-being. (, , .603)
  3. A5, Make people feel at ease. (, , .577)
  4. A4, Love children. (, , .456)
  5. E4, Make friends easily. (, , .362)
  6. A1, Am indifferent to the feelings of others. (, , -.360)
  7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (, , .303)

LLM Interpretation:
ML5 captures prosocial orientation, evidenced by strong loadings on A2–A5 (0.45–0.67) reflecting concern for others, comforting, and fostering ease. The factor’s negative loading on A1 indicates that indifference detracts from the construct. Low correlations with the other factors (e.g., r≈–.31 with Introverted Social Tendencies) suggest a distinct social warmth dimension. Its moderate association with Openness (r=.20) and low relation to Neurotic Tendencies reflects its unique, adaptive social engagement profile for behavior regulation. This construct aligns with Agreeableness traits from the Big Five.

Factor 3 (ML1) - Low Extraversion
Number of significant loadings: 7
Variance explained: 7.36%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = .23, ML5 = -.31, ML3 = -.22, ML4 = -.17

Variables:
  1. E2, Find it difficult to approach others. (, , .667)
  2. E1, Don't talk a lot. (, , .565)
  3. E4, Make friends easily. (, , -.527)
  4. N4, Often feel blue. (, , .420)
  5. E5, Take charge. (, , -.394)
  6. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (, , .357)
  7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (, , -.341)

LLM Interpretation:
ML1 represents low extraversion or introversion, strongly loading on E1 (talk‑less, 0.57) and E2 (social approach difficulty, 0.67). Negative loadings on E3 (captivate people), E4 (make friends), and E5 (take charge) further characterize reduced outward energy. The factor also captures modest internalizing aspects with positive loadings on O4 (reflecting introverted cognition, 0.36) and mild neurotic items (N4, N5). Its positive correlation with Neurotic Tendencies (r=.23) and negative link with Conscientiousness (r≈–.22) illustrate its role particularly for others in guarded social interaction.

Factor 4 (ML3) - Conscientiousness
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 7.71%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.21, ML5 = .20, ML1 = -.22, ML4 = .20

Variables:
  1. C4, Do things in a half-way manner. (, , -.643)
  2. C2, Continue until everything is perfect. (, , .638)
  3. C5, Waste my time. (, , -.570)
  4. C3, Do things according to a plan. (, , .564)
  5. C1, Am exacting in my work. (, , .532)

LLM Interpretation:
ML3 signifies conscientiousness, driven by high positive loadings on C1–C3 (0.53–0.64) that capture exactness, perseverance, and planning. Negative loadings on C4 (half‑way approach) and C5 (time wasting) emphasize low procrastination and sloppiness. The factor exhibits a weak negative correlation with Introverted Social Tendencies (r≈–.22) and a small positive link to Openness (r=.20). ML3 therefore denotes a structured, diligent mindset that contrasts with impulsivity and emotional reactivity, mirroring the Big Five’s conscientiousness dimension, providing a foundation for goal attainment and reliable self‑regulation.

Factor 5 (ML4) - Openness
Number of significant loadings: 6
Variance explained: 6.25%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.01, ML5 = .23, ML1 = -.17, ML3 = .20

Variables:
  1. O3, Carry the conversation to a higher level. (, , .633)
  2. O1, Am full of ideas. (, , .534)
  3. O5, Will not probe deeply into a subject. (, , -.522)
  4. O2, Avoid difficult reading material. (, , -.441)
  5. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (, , .379)
  6. E3, Know how to captivate people. (, , .315)

LLM Interpretation:
ML4 captures openness to experience, with strong positive loadings on O1 (ideas, .53) and O3 (conversation depth, .63) and moderate positive on O4 (.38). Negative loadings on O2 (avoiding reading) and O5 (non‑probe) reflect a preference for intellectual challenge over routine. The factor is weakly correlated with Introverted Social Tendencies (.20) and positively linked to Prosocial Orientation (.23). ML4 therefore reflects intellectual curiosity and imaginative engagement, aligning with the Openness dimension of the Big Five, supporting creative problem‑solving in varied contexts.
