DETAILED FACTOR INTERPRETATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Factor 1 (ML2) - Emotional Instability
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 9.65%
Factor Correlations: ML5 = -.03, ML1 = .23, ML3 = -.21, ML4 = -.01

Variables:
  1. N1, Get angry easily. (, , .852)
  2. N2, Get irritated easily. (, , .817)
  3. N3, Have frequent mood swings. (, , .665)
  4. N5, Panic easily. (, , .439)
  5. N4, Often feel blue. (, , .413)

LLM Interpretation:
Emotional Instability reflects an individual’s tendency toward frequent, intense negative affect. High positive loadings on anger (.852), irritation (.817), mood swings (.665), depressive feelings (.413), and panic (.439) converge the factor as a coherent negative affect dimension. The factor shows weak associations with other dimensions, confirming discriminant validity. Minor overlaps with extraversion and conscientiousness suggest occasional anxious introversion, but overall the construct is distinctly centered on emotional volatility.

Factor 2 (ML5) - Empathic Compassion
Number of significant loadings: 7
Variance explained: 7.69%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.03, ML1 = -.31, ML3 = .20, ML4 = .23

Variables:
  1. A3, Know how to comfort others. (, , .668)
  2. A2, Inquire about others' well-being. (, , .603)
  3. A5, Make people feel at ease. (, , .577)
  4. A4, Love children. (, , .456)
  5. E4, Make friends easily. (, , .362)
  6. A1, Am indifferent to the feelings of others. (, , -.360)
  7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (, , .303)

LLM Interpretation:
Empathic Compassion captures the capacity to care for others and alleviate distress. Variables A2 (.603), A3 (.668), A4 (.456), and A5 (.577) load strongly, signifying a cohesive caring sub‑scale. Small positive loadings on E3 (.303) and E4 (.362) indicate that social engagement reinforces this trait, while absence of loadings on neurotic or extraversion items confirms discriminant validity. The factor reflects a stable, compassionate orientation toward interpersonal support.

Factor 3 (ML1) - Introversion
Number of significant loadings: 7
Variance explained: 7.36%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = .23, ML5 = -.31, ML3 = -.22, ML4 = -.17

Variables:
  1. E2, Find it difficult to approach others. (, , .667)
  2. E1, Don't talk a lot. (, , .565)
  3. E4, Make friends easily. (, , -.527)
  4. N4, Often feel blue. (, , .420)
  5. E5, Take charge. (, , -.394)
  6. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (, , .357)
  7. E3, Know how to captivate people. (, , -.341)

LLM Interpretation:
Introversion is defined by a preference for quieter environments and reduced social engagement. Loadings of .565 on ‘Don’t talk a lot’ and .667 on ‘Find it difficult to approach others’ contrast sharply with negative loadings on social confidence (.E3 -.341, .E4 -.527, .E5 -.394), reinforcing a coherent introverted profile. The factor shows moderate correlation with Neuroticism (.23) and modest links to the other traits, suggesting it is distinct yet related to negative affect.

Factor 4 (ML3) - Conscientiousness
Number of significant loadings: 5
Variance explained: 7.71%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.21, ML5 = .20, ML1 = -.22, ML4 = .20

Variables:
  1. C4, Do things in a half-way manner. (, , -.643)
  2. C2, Continue until everything is perfect. (, , .638)
  3. C5, Waste my time. (, , -.570)
  4. C3, Do things according to a plan. (, , .564)
  5. C1, Am exacting in my work. (, , .532)

LLM Interpretation:
Conscientiousness is characterized by a strong drive for precision, planning, and task completion. Items C1 (.532) ‘exacting’, C2 (.638) ‘continue until perfect’, and C3 (.564) ‘planful’ load positively, whereas C4 (. – .643) and C5 (– .570) load negatively, revealing a clear distinction between organized and careless styles. The factor explains workplace reliability and discipline. Correlations with Introversion (.23) and Emotional Instability (.23) remain low, underscoring discriminant validity.

Factor 5 (ML4) - Openness to Experience
Number of significant loadings: 6
Variance explained: 6.25%
Factor Correlations: ML2 = -.01, ML5 = .23, ML1 = -.17, ML3 = .20

Variables:
  1. O3, Carry the conversation to a higher level. (, , .633)
  2. O1, Am full of ideas. (, , .534)
  3. O5, Will not probe deeply into a subject. (, , -.522)
  4. O2, Avoid difficult reading material. (, , -.441)
  5. O4, Spend time reflecting on things. (, , .379)
  6. E3, Know how to captivate people. (, , .315)

LLM Interpretation:
Openness to Experience captures intellectual curiosity and imaginative thinking. High loadings on O1 (.534) ‘full of ideas’, O3 (.633) ‘carry conversation to higher level’, O4 (.379) ‘spend time reflecting’ illustrate a cohesive imaginative domain, while the negative loading on O5 (–.522) ‘will not probe deeply’ indicates a preference for breadth over narrow depth. Small links to other factors confirm discriminant validity. The pattern aligns with theoretical expectations that openness fosters creative, reflective engagement, contrasting with the structured orientation of Conscientiousness.
