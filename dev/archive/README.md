## Why Archive?

These files represented incremental development documentation that accumulated over time. By synthesizing them into a single, well-organized DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md, we:

1. **Eliminated redundancy** - No duplicate information across files
2. **Improved organization** - Logical structure with clear sections
3. **Enhanced maintainability** - Single source of truth for technical docs
4. **Better navigation** - Table of contents and cross-references

## Should You Use These Files?

**No.** Always refer to:
- **dev/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md** for technical architecture and implementation details
- **CLAUDE.md** for usage guide, workflows, and quick reference

These archived files are kept for historical reference only.
